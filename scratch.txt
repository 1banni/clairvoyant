title: "Notes on Atlantic-World Painting from a Visit to the National Gallery of Art"
body: "Three capable men dominated and defined English painting in the high period of the Hanoverian kings. These were Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Wright of Derby, and Joshua Reynolds, later knighted by George III.\nGainsborough was the pleasing painter to the nouveau riche, remembered best today for his gauzy, pastoral paintings of figures like Mr and Mrs Andrews. Sniffing at London society from his comfortable workshop in Bath, he painted the upper class and their families with an unceasing industry. Signs of this you can see in two paintings a few rooms apart in the National Gallery’s collection – although the portraits are gorgeous and done with the masterly care that made him famous, the backgrounds are essentially identical, anticipatory in a perverse way of the scroll-mechanism backgrounds of late 20th century department store family portraiture.\nReynolds was London’s favorite, a man who hobnobbed with leading lights of the age like Adam Smith, Dr Samuel Johnson, and James Boswell. Steady, focused compositions of courtly figures were his watchword. Joseph Wright, remembered with the strange moniker “of Derby,” innovated in the depiction of science. Whether in clinics or cozy hearths, Wright’s learned men exhibited the newfound principles of physics and anatomy in exquisite detail.\nThe acme of their common achievements came in 1768 when Reynolds and his circle in London successfully petitioned the King for a charter to create the Royal Society. Kindly, Reynolds invited Gainsborough to become a founding member as well, although he was slighted by being out of Zoffany’s depiction of the initial class.\nWhen the three of them passed on in the last decade of the eighteenth century, they left in their place a vacuum which would come to be filled by two new competing forces – the neoclassicism of the Americans and the romanticism of their young fellow countrymen. \nAmerican painting emerges from the Revolutionary period with a surprising degree of strength. Shedding its “naive” period, a style whose formal qualities gave it a look that remains odd today, the greatest of the new generation of painters in the early republic sang the new nation from bottom to top. Gilbert Stuart and John Trumbull painted the founding fathers in warm reds surrounded by fascia and other appurtenances of Roman descent, a motivic language they could speak to other Atlantic-world court painters in the age of revolutions, certainly to men no less than David in France.\nBy contrast the new Englishmen took their cues from the continent, where the nation’s focus was trained for the better part of three decades after 1793. In gloomy Brandenburg, Goethe and Schiller and Friedrich put together brooding, agony-filled works of art in a style called the Romantic, and painters like John Constable and JMW Turner took to this with ferocity. Turner is the exemplar, something like a prophet of the modern, his swirling seascapes breaking the geometry of reality to emphasize the inescapable tempest of nascent industrial life. Pat scenes of ships-o’-the-line in combat off Brest became in his hands transcendental tableaux; a railroad crossing the Thames opens a portal to the future in Dionysian mystery, bursting the door open wide for Wassily Kandinsky and Georges Braque, whose hearts we can understand as our own.\nAn evolutionary missing link is presented by the work of John Martin, who was born after the death of Sir Reynolds. His painting below, Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still Upon Gibeon, struck me when I saw it while younger and still does so today. If we need to give it labels, it mixes history and landscape painting on an epic scale – depictions of triumph are old as dirt, but the panache Martin invests in his 5’x7′ canvas (which is huge!) sets this apart.\nLightning and hail strike the fleeing Canaanites while epic ziggurats look on smooth and petrified. The sun and moon spill unnatural amounts of light in their own corners of the painting, leaving the rest of the scene shadowed, which imparts to the viewer the feeling of watching a show during an eclipse.\nMartin’s biblical architecture wouldn’t feel out of place in the megalomania of Fritz Lang, a comparison of artists perhaps not as far off as it might seem – Martin was disdained even in his own time for an overweening sentimentality, a dedication to a sort of Sir Walter Scott-esque arc of history which others around him found merely jejune.\nI like Martin, and I like Gainsborough and all the rest of the people who made their living putting oil to canvas. We miss their scale of interpretation and their care for the details. David Lynch said that he got into filmmaking in order to make paintings that moved, but we’re not making many more Lynches these days."

title: "Local Notes No. 8 – The Prehistory of Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena"
body: "In the 1995-96 NBA season, Gary Payton, point guard for Seattle’s SuperSonics, did something remarkable – in addition to recording a box score of 19 points, 7 assists, and 4 rebounds per game, he punished lollygagging opponents by stealing the ball 231 times in the regular season. For this effort he earned the nickname The Glove; by the by he was also awarded Defensive Player of the Year.\nPayton’s teammates, rallied by his monster effort on both sides of the floor, pitched in as well and ended up winning 68 games. This streak they continued in the playoffs to become Western Conference champions. Despite having such formidable accessory weaponry as Detlef Schrempf and a 20/2/11 Shawn Kemp available at veteran coach George Karl’s disposal, Seattle never got to celebrate ultimate glory – as was the case with most NBA success stories in the 1990s, Payton’s Sonics ran into the brick wall of Michael Jordan’s Bulls, who put them away 4-2 in the league finals to begin their second threepeat.\nThe Sonics earned well over half of those 68 wins at a stadium then doing business for the first season under a new name – KeyArena, named for the venerable Midwestern regional depositary KeyBank, whose $15.1 million bid for the naming rights satisfied Seattle mayor Norm Rice’s long-held dreams for a state-of-the-art pro sports facility in the Emerald City. (Until last month, Rice had been Seattle’s only black elected mayor – Bruce Harrell just became the second.) In fact, while mayor Rice’s architects were busy renovating the KeyArena-in-waiting, Payton’s Sonics were briefly ousted from Seattle, playing instead at a PNW motorist’s favorite landmark, the TacomaDome, some 30 miles to the south.\nTwo-time Seattle Mayor Norm Rice overseeing the groundbreaking of the new City Hall in 2001. Source: HistoryLink\nIn the 27 seasons before 1994, the SuperSonics played their home games at the same arena, then named simply the Coliseum. It finished construction in 1964 under the watchful eyes of Paul Thiry, who had a slightly scaled-down version built two years prior for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair; the Space Needle was first unveiled for the same occasion.\nThe Coliseum undergoing construction in 1961, ahead of the Seattle World’s Fair. Source: Issuu\nThe Beatles performed twice at the Coliseum to crowds of 14,000; three other professional sports franchises played there; it hosted the NBA’s All-Star Weekend in 1987, and future Sonics vanquisher Michael Jordan won his first dunk contest there.\nFive years after the best moment KeyArena had yet had, the Sonics’ Game 5 win over the Bulls on a Friday in June of 1996, ownership of the team transferred to local nincompoop Howard Schultz, then CEO of Starbucks and lately a presidential pretender. The coffee mogul went to Seattle City Council a few years later hoping to have the renovation costs of KeyArena publicly defrayed; when this attempt at financial hardball failed, he sold the team to a willing gaggle of oil and gas enthusiasts of Oklahoman extraction.\nWhat follows is famous – Aubrey McClendon, who pioneered fracking and founded Chesapeake Energy, an entity solely responsible for 1 in every 1000 lbs of industrial greenhouse gases emitted in the thirty years following 1988, shanghaied the Sonics to Oklahoma City. They became the Thunder, and Kevin Durant became the last NBA player ever drafted in Seattle.\nOklahoma City Thunder part owner Aubrey McClendon dies in car crash after  indictment\nThe Fracking King himself, who met an untimely end in 2016 (Chevy Tahoe, concrete pillar). Source: ESPN\nPerhaps you get the point I’m trying to make by now; if not, a dash more history brings us to the present. With no regular tenant, the building born for a World’s Fair fell into disrepair. KeyBank declined to renew their naming rights in 2011, but with no suitors on offer, the arena continued to go by the bank’s title, like some Austenite waif doomed to marry her parents’ first choice. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman sniffed at the possibility of an expansion team calling it home. The NBA simply ignored the prospect.\nBy 2016, however, conditions in Seattle had changed sufficiently to admit a second life for the pyramid. Now-disgraced but then-mayor Ed Murray, approaching reelection, made KeyArena’s revitalization a pet project; when he resigned the following year, his replacement, Jenny Durkan, brought the campaign across the finish line. A contractor was selected in 2017 – the NHL joined negotiations the following week – and by late 2018, the lurid powers-that-be of the hockey world had granted Seattle their Kraken. The NBA, never unhappy to join a party, sent the stadium off for extensive renovation with a preseason exhibition game between Durant’s new team, the Golden State Warriors, and the hapless Sacramento Kings – Durant scored 26 points to win.\nWhile Murray-Durkan opportunism was certainly one driver of KeyArena’s rehab, the other was likely more impactful. For by 2017, Seattle’s homegrown corporate Cthulhu du jour, Amazon, had swallowed up half of the e-commerce market. Financial commentator Jim Cramer that same year included the company in his coining of the acronym FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) to describe the technology powerhouses whose soaring valuations would propel equity markets to their dizzying heights in the Trump era.\nThe Amazon Spheres in South Lake Union, Seattle. (I think the Spheres are cool fwiw). Source: CNBC\nSuch prowess had given Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, dreams of grandeur; finding time away from his philanthropic, romantic, and extraterrestrially avionic efforts, he sent a trunk of ducats down Mercer St and asked if the city would be so kind as to begin referring to the Seattle Center Arena (neé KeyArena (neé Coliseum)) as the Climate Pledge Arena."

title: "Local Notes No. 7 – ‘Iolani Palace, the US’ Only Royal Residence"
body: "The most famous examples of Hawaiian architecture are often identified with the somewhat tropical strain of modernism that infected the islands in the postwar boom. This makes a natural degree of sense: after all, statehood and Elvis arrived in the îles Sandwiches at the zenith of the Jet Age, when PanAm established a new tourist mecca in Waikiki and the Rat Pack could be found sipping mai-tais at the bar of the Coco Palms Resort.\nImage may contain Summer Plant Palm Tree Arecaceae Tree Building Architecture and Tropical\nOn a recent visit, though, I was equally drawn to the fine buildings constructed before annexation. The Bishop Museum’s Hawaiian Hall, built in 1889 by the firm of William F. Smith (about whom the building’s application for status in the National Register of Historic Places says “little is known”), was one of the most striking.\nThe Hawaiian Hall of the Bishop Museum.\nIntended as a monument to the last member of the Kamehameha dynasty, Princess Bernice Pauahi, it’s a beautiful example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, whose elements Philadelphians may have a leg up in recognizing – I found it reminiscent of Frank Furness’ buildings, like the PAFA or Penn’s Fisher Fine Arts Library.\nThe 4-story Main Reading Room acts as a lightwell for the inner rooms surrounding it.\nThe unbeatable Fisher Fine Arts Library. Source: Wiki\nStill more striking was the ‘Iolani Palace, the only royal palace ever built on US soil. Its construction began five years into the reign of King Kalākaua, on the last day of 1879. Over the course of the next three years, three architects would see the palace to completion – Thomas Baker put together the blueprints and his handiwork formed its final design, but he was sacked and moved to Australia in 1880, really just a few weeks after ground was broken. Charles Wall shipped in from a San Francisco racked by the economic spasms of the Panic of 1873 to continue the work, but he couldn’t please Kalākaua either, which left the otherwise unknown Isaac Moore to finish the job.\n‘Iolani all dolled up with the standard of Kamehameha at left. Source: the palace’s FB page lol\nThe Palace is undoubtedly handsome. Its masonry glimmers beige and heather green in understated contrast to the joyful bounty of its surrounding grounds. The structure sports mansard roofs in the Second Empire style and fine Corinthian columns supporting broad verandas (lana’i) fronting both floors.\nIolani Palace – MASON\nA gazebo on the southwestern corner, which still stands today, was built for Kalākaua’s coronation ceremony in 1883; other records from the kingdom period show the palace’s frequent ritual and ceremonial usage.\nThe gazebo decorated for the 1883 coronation.\nOne rather ignominious ceremony the Palace was host to took place in 1898 – this was the annexation of Hawai’i by the United States, against the explicit protestation of the country’s rightful sovereign, the Queen Lili’uokalani. Marines from the USS Philadelphia decked out in their whites let down Kamehameha’s standard and rose the American flag in its place. Inside, the ex-Queen, confined to house arrest since the coup of 1893, waited and waited.\nRaising the American flag at ‘Iolani Palace.\nThe American annexation of 1898 brought an end to a century of independent dynastic rule by native Hawaiians of Hawai’i, a remarkable achievement comparable to the defenses against colonialism achieved by Thailand or Ethiopia in other periods. Kamehameha the Great, until his late 40s nothing more than one chief among chiefs on the Big Island, waged a series of wars to consolidate power beginning in the 1790s, ending in success and unification under his rule around 1810.1\nKing Kamehameha Statue, Oahu | Go Hawaii\nThomas Gould’s statue of Kamehameha the Great stands across from ‘Iolani on the grounds of the State Supreme Court. A replica stands in the US Capitol. Source: GoHawaii\nHis successor, Kamehameha II, nearly fumbled the bag on a trip to Britain – an anglophile tradition persisted in the kings of Hawai’i for several generations – but from what the record suggests, threat of the paperwork that would have ensued, as well as Kamehameha II’s untimely death from tuberculosis in London in 1824, dissuaded the British Foreign Office from outright conquering the islands and so they went on a sovereign nation in the north Pacific.\nKamehameha III faced down another British annexation attempt in 1843 and reshaped the government into a constitutional monarchy with strong rule of law. Kalākaua dramatically revamped the economy by entering into a free trade deal with the US, leading to an economic boom which attracted American business interests. When Lili’uokalani attempted to rejigger the balance of political power in the kingdom with the promulgation of the Constitution of 1893, those same interests – notably including Samuel Dole, cousin to pineapple mogul James Dole – forcibly overthrew the monarchy.\nQueen Liliuokalani leaves Aliiolani Hale, 1/14/1893\nQueen Lili’uokalani leaving Ai’iolani Hale, now the State Supreme Court, just across King St from ‘Iolani Palace, after announcing the new Constitution.

President Grover Cleveland thought the whole thing a miscarriage of justice and refused the coup plotters’ petitions for immediate annexation; the now Republic of Hawai’i could only then muddle along for a few years, in which intervening time a monarchist party led an abortive restoration attempt, until William McKinley could be elected President, after which the coming of American imperialism was proudly, irrevocably declared in the bowels of the USS Maine.\nSanford Ballard Dole -- Elected Legislator and Appointed Supreme Court  Justice of the Kingdom of Hawaii; President of the Provisional Government  and of the Republic of Hawaii; Governor of the Territory of\nSanford Dole inaugurated as first Governor of the Territory of Hawaii at ‘Iolani Palace, 1898. Source: this weirdo Dole apologist guy’s website\nAlthough Dole would continue to rule from ‘Iolani during the Republic period and into his tenure as Governor of the Territory, the Palace is better memorialized in service of the lost majesty of its kings and queens. Indeed, Lili’uokalani, last queen of this magnificent monument to an independent, modern nation-state built atop mere earthen toeholds of volcanism 3000 miles away from the nearest continent, fittingly composed a song of farewell which later came to stand metonymically for the American takeover and all it meant for Hawaii: Aloha ‘Oe."

title: "A Visitor’s Guide to A Coruña, Spain"
body: "I was delighted last week to be able to spend time in A Coruña, a seaside city in Galicia, Spain’s northwestern–most province. Galicia has long suffered from a dearth of attention, especially in comparison to Spain’s nearly mythic Mediterranean coast, from Barcelona on down; and despite lying just 100mi from the border with Portugal, A Coruña did not receive the bump in attention paid to Porto, Lisbon, and the Algarve when travel to the Lusophone Atlantic coast of Iberia came into vogue.\nWith this post, then, I’m going to try and make amends. This will be a by-the-books travel guide to A Coruña, including how to get there, where to stay, and what to do while you’re there. I had a blast with my time and I think you will too.\nOverview\nA Coruña lies in the northwest of Galicia, itself the northwest of Spain. Together with its suburbs, the city boasts a total population of about 400,000 – in US terms, its size is comparable to that of Asheville, NC, Santa Barbara, CA, or even Anchorage, AK.\nIts weather and environs hew much more closely to the cities of the Pacific Northwest, which is why in the subhed I called it “Spain’s Portland” (and I mean Portland, OR); it’s intermittently rainy and cloudy a lot of the time, but rarely stormy or snowy, and heat in summer is softened by the breeze from the ocean.\nA Coruña seen looking southeast from the ocean – the Tower of Hercules is at bottom-left, Riazor Beach middle-right. Source: Galiciatips.com\nMuch of the city lies on a peninsula which extends into a leeward bay known as the Ría da Coruña – opposite the city across the bay lies Ferrol, once an important shipbuilding town. The Ría da Coruña is exemplary of the geography of littoral Galicia, with the verdant coastal land rising rather steeply and irregularly from sea level to form the surrounding hills and dales. Rías like this can be found elsewhere in the world – they are basically the same as Scandinavian fjords, with quibbles over whether glacier action carved the landscape – but were named for the first time on the Galician coast.\nIf population totals don’t mean much to you, I’ll add that the city feels bigger in terms of geography and smaller in terms of population than it seems. Taking in the sights required several 20k+ step count days, but in my time there I ran into a few repeat customers, including one lovely doña who introduced her 17-year-old dog and informed me it was her cat’s birthday the next Sunday, then showed me a picture of said birthday when I saw her at the cafe Monday.\nThe city’s name – A Coruña – may look odd to those familiar with Spanish, but that is because it is given in Galician, a Spanish dialect closer to Portuguese. To get its name in Spanish, simply switch the A for La. Since the democratic transition, the government in Galicia has promoted the use of their dialect, also called gallego. However, this should not be cause for alarm on the traveler’s part: everyone in the city speaks perfectly normal (and very clear, I thought) Castilian Spanish, and almost everyone speaks better English than your Spanish anyway.\nHistory, Deep and Recent, and Current State\nDeep History\nIn his excellent The Celts: A Very Short Introduction, Cambridge archaeologist Barry Cunliffe challenges us to rethink our familiar notions of European geography:\nA glance at the map of Europe, suitably adjusted to jolt our cognitive geography, is sufficient to stress that Atlantic Europe is a cohesive region. Its many promontories and peninsulas are linked by the ocean, while the flooded valleys of its ria coastlines provide sheltered waters reaching deep inland. The great rivers of France and Iberia flowing westwards into the ocean are arteries of communication binding huge swathes of inland territory to the littoral zone.\nCunliffe, The Celts\nCunliffe focuses on Atlantic Europe as the natural homeland of the Celts, an ancient people who lived down from the Algarve in Portugal through Galicia and French Bordeaux and Brittany all the way up to Ireland and Wales. This ancient cross-European cultural continuity gets some play in Galicia today – souvenir shops sell emblems and necklaces with goofy “Celtic symbols” to tourists – but the region’s Celtic roots are much less important to its history than what came after.\nWhat – or rather who – came after was Julius Caesar and the Romans. Caesar came to A Coruña in 62 BC and established trade in iron with France and England around the Bay of Biscay, a pattern of intercultural communication which would repeat endlessly through Galician history. In the second century, Roman imperial administrators under Trajan or somelike set about building a nice big lighthouse at the end of the peninsula of Coruña – this is the Tower of Hercules, which stands today and is therefore the oldest extant lighthouse in the world.\nThe band of stone wrapping a helix up the tower is evidence of the old spiral ramp used to scale it, now lost.\nAfter Rome, A Coruña’s status as a rich and well-connected coastal city opened it up for intermittent invasion by the Vikings, while its Romano-Iberian neighbors to the south fell eventually to the great conquest of Al-Andalus perpetrated by the Umayyads.\nBy the early 800s the kings of Asturias had reestablished a beachhead of Christian rule in northern Spain, including Galicia. Then around 814, Alfonso II (there would be eleven more Alfonsos ruling Spain) learned that some peasants had found bones supposedly belonging to Saint James the Greater, one of Jesus’ Apostles. Seizing upon the opportunity to up his status as a defender of Christendom, Alfonso II affirmed the identity of the remains and declared that a great cathedral be built on its site – this became the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and the pilgrimage to it the Camino de Santiago.\nSantiago di Compostela Jubilee: A time of grace, healing and encounter -  Vatican News\nWhile Coruña was not the ultimate destination of the Camino, the Camino changed it as well. Pilgrims on the Camino came from all Christendom as part of a large network of pilgrimages active in the High Middle Ages – Ken Follett’s indescribably popular 1989 novel, The Pillars of the Earth, dramatizes this well in one of its later chapters. But most of those pilgrims ended up coming from France, and the development of the overland routes of travel through northern Spain influenced Coruña and Galicia greatly. Monasteries sprouted up all over Galicia and grew rich and powerful from the income of the pilgrims; the monks began to grow wine, leading to the division of varietals handed down to us today.\nGalicia Spain Wine Map\nDrank a lot of lovely Ribeira Sacra on this trip. Source: Wine Scholar Guild.\nThe resumption of cross-cultural communication in Galicia in the High Middle Ages would deal a nasty sting to the region as we turn to the early modern; the Black Death arrived in Iberia at Galicia, via those Biscay-based water routes established by the Romans. But for all the suffering the Galicians survived in the 1400s, the birth of empire in the 1500s led to better times. The Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, built their Royal Audiencia in Coruña, and their successor Carlos I (Charles V to his subjects in the Holy Roman Empire) established one of his Casas de la Contratación in the city as well, this one devoted to the spice trade.\nThe Spanish Armada departed from Ferrol in 1588. After that lucky storm wrecked it, Francis Drake raided Coruña in retribution in 1589, but was repelled thanks in part to the efforts of a brave woman known as Maria Pita, whose name adorns the city’s main square today.\nPlaza Maria Pita and the Royal Audiencia established by Ferdinand and Isabella. Source: me!\nRecent History\nWhen Napoleon invaded Spain in the Peninsular Wars, the Coruñeros fought back again, this time aided by the British. The 1809 Battle of Corunna was a Dunkirk moment 130 years before the one we know today in Normandy took place, as 26,000 British troops out of an expeditionary force of 35,000 escaped back to their ships in the Bay of Biscay. Sir John Moore, commander of the British forces in Spain, was wounded and died in Coruña; the Jardin San Carlos in the city’s Marina is devoted to him.\nFast forwarding a bit more, Francisco Franco was born in Ferrol in 1892. He would go on to lead the Right in the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, after which he would rule Spain singlehandedly for 36 more years. Franco took as his country home the Pazo de Meirás in the hills outside Coruña; oddly enough, that specific home had previously belonged to one of Spain’s most celebrated modern novelists, Emilia Pardo Bazan, who was born there into a noble Coruñero family in 1851.\nAfter the transition to democracy, Galicia was promoted to the status of autonomous community, making it co-equal to Catalonia, Andalusia, the Basque Country, etc. The local government has since promoted the use of Galician, which is why you’ll see it on signs and hear it on the street occasionally.\nCurrent State\nA Coruña was changed immeasurably in 1975, when Amancio Ortega opened up his first Zara in the city center. Since then, Zara has grown to be the flagship chain of Inditex, Ortega’s conglomerate and the world’s largest apparel retailer. Inditex’s 100bn Euro valuation is good enough to make Ortega the world’s 11th richest man.\nInditex dominates the region’s economy. Its headquarters, in rural Arteixo, employs 5,000 designers who are shuttled out from the city daily. You can’t go more than a couple blocks without seeing one Inditex store or another, including its crown jewel, the Zara flagship, which lies at the intersection of the Calle de Sanchez Bregua and the Calle Compostela, one block from the ocean.\nEPR Retail News | SPAIN: Zara opens flagship store on calle Compostela 3,  one of A Coruña's prime shopping streets\nInterior of the 5-story Zara flagship – menswear on floor 5.\nZara brought modernity and industry to the city, attracting designers and models from all over the world, who went on to demand big-city amenities. Couture boutiques like Iamnue Store sprung up in its wake, as did fine dining of various cuisines, helping diversify the Galician diet away from its traditional reliance on mariscos.\nTienda de Ropa Iamnue Store en A Coruña\nImagine if you could buy Comme des Garçons and Acne Studios in York, PA. That’s what Coruña is like.\nThis novel modernity has made A Coruña a very lively place. Professionals of all stripes walk its streets and crowd its bars alongside Erasmus students from across Europe. If there’s a baby bust plaguing modern Spain, you couldn’t tell by looking at Coruña – almost every young couple I saw had a baby in tow, and the playground of the Plaza Pontevedra in the city center was filled daily with shouts of playing kids.\nLife is good in A Coruña, which also engenders a certain chill among its inhabitants. People were very happy indeed to spend their days at big restaurant tables, taking cañas of Estrella Galicia or bumming out on their lovely beaches like Riazor or Santa Caterina. For travelers more accustomed to the haughty monuments of Madrid or the sun-drenched Mediterranean coast, A Coruña’s different pace of life has a lot to offer.\nGetting There\nA Coruña has a small airport with mostly-daily flights to Madrid and Barcelona – according to Expedia, you can even get there from London-Gatwick.\nIf you’ve got the time, though, take the train. There are about 5 daily trains from Madrid’s Chamartin Station to Coruña via Renfe, the national rail operator. The journey takes 5-6 hours and lets you soak in the varied geography of Spain while also going through other Galician cities like Ourense and Santiago.\nSights to See\nCiudad Vieja\nLarge, pedestrian neighborhood entirely paved by cobblestones and hemmed in by tall townhouses which emerge occasionally into breathtakingly peaceful courtyards. Reminiscent of Venice in its breadth – you could spend your entire stay here.\nPlaza Maria Pita\nLarge broad plaza at the narrow northern end of the isthmus, home to the Royal Audiencia established by the Catholic Monarchs. The statue at middle commemorates Maria Pita, a Coruñera who assisted in the defense of the city against the marauding British under the command of Francis Drake.\nEl Ayuntamiento en la Plaza de Maria Pita - Picture of La Coruna, Province  of A Coruna - Tripadvisor\nMarina\nThe best place in the city to see examples of A Coruña’s characteristic architectural motif – the galerias, facade-wide bay windows which imitate the aft walls of large galleys.\nZona del PARROTE hacia la ciudad vieja de La Coruña desde el puerto  deportivo. - Photo de La Corogne, Province of A Coruna - Tripadvisor\nRiazor Beach\nBeach on the western side of the isthmus, facing the ocean. At low tide quite rocky, but no less beautiful.\nMonte San Pedro\nLarge park on the hilltop to the southwest of city center – can be accessed via taxi or via a cool funicular which takes you to a big observatory. Great restaurant up there too.\nFile:Ascensor ó monte San Pedro, A Coruña.jpg - Wikimedia Commons\nTower of Hercules\nAlready mentioned, but site of the oldest extant lighthouse in the world, built by the Romans in the early part of the first millennium. Lovely park surrounding it, with the compass rose of the Celts and a statue of a Celtic king.\nRiazor Stadium\nHome to Real Club Deportivo La Coruña, the city’s soccer team, which plays currently in the fourth league. At one time (2005) they were actually good enough to win La Liga championship, but people love them regardless and I’m sure catching a game there would be a tremendous experience.\nStadium Guide: Estadio Riazor, Deportivo La Coruna\nEstrella Galicia Museum\nThe Museo Estrella Galicia (MEGA) is a baffling thing – an absolute corporate narcissism and meticulously detailed and curated museum of the history of beer at the same time. At one point, a theme park ride puts you inside a vat of barley as you become hops. The 25 euro ticket is worth it for all the free beer at the end, but this is a long tour.\nMuseums\nThe Museo de las Bellas Artes da Coruña was very well-equipped, with a great selection of portraits from the 16th century up to the modern era. Also had a lovely collection just of Goya sketches. Other museums focus on Pablo Picasso, who spent his adolescence in the city.\nChurches\nThe Colegiata de Santa María del Campo, located behind Plaza Maria Pita, dates back to the 12th century, which is sort of incredible in its own right. Otherwise go for the Parroquia de San Jorge, which is about 100 years younger.\nEating and Drinking\nAs an addendum to this section, I’ve put all these great bars and restaurants in a Google Map, available for viewing here.\nBakeries, cafes and fruterías\nEvery block in A Coruña has its own bakery and its own frutería. While there are supermarkets, people rely on these local shops for their fresh goods, and how fresh they are. Upscale bakeries like Tahona offer truly scrumptious treats with the Scandinavian industrial-chic design affectation a New York-based traveler might already be homesick for.\nSome of my favorite cafes: Tahona, Vazva, Cafe Central Park, Astro Coffee, Cafe Siboney\nPanadería Tahona inaugura un nuevo establecimiento en la Ciudad Escolar de  A Coruña\nSeafood\nCab drivers in Madrid on the way to the train will tell you to eat the seafood in Galicia, and they’re not wrong. All of it’s good, but try taking the little tapas camarones at Os Tigres on Calle Galera. Very lovely.\nSome of my favorites: A Mundiña, NaDo, Peculiar, Gastromaar, Terreo Cocina Casual\nBars\nLike I said earlier, there are a lot of kids and students in A Coruña, and they will absolutely mob bars along Calle Juan Canalejo basically every night of the week. Bars tend to close at 1am but there are clubs, lines for which you’ll see begin to form as the street-fronts close up.\nSome of my favorites: Twin Fin, La Maleta, La Tata, Abuela Josefa, Kvras\nPUNTOS DE RUMBA | Rumba is good\nOtherwise\nIf you’re hungry for some other cuisines, I had great Thai at KohLanta, great ramen at Monkee Ramen, and great poke and sushi at Restaurante Samyo in Quatro Caminos.\nShopping and city life\nCoruñeros shop for clothes like Americans shop for gadgets – when in Rome, do as the Romans and go shopping!\nDefinitely try the Inditex complex – any of the several Zaras, the Massimo Dutti, Pull & Bear, and Bershkas available in city center all fantastic.\nBoutiques in city center are great as well, and it’s fun shopping at the David in the relationship when Goliath is worth 100bn Euros.\nIt’s worth heading for Marineda City, the giant mall built on the city outskirts in 2011. If you’re dying for it, they’ve got the region’s only McDonalds and Starbucks.\nCoruñeros also prioritize chilling\nSiesta is pretty well-adhered to most days – don’t try and go shopping or out to eat between 2pm and 5pm\nPlaza Pontevedra always has kids screaming and skateboarding thanks to the Colegio which fronts it. Otherwise, Plaza Maria Pita is gorgeous, as are the Plaza de Galicia and Plaza de España. For a nice day trip, try going to Santa Cristina Beach in Oleiros."

title: "Coming Late to McPherson’s \“Battle Cry of Freedom\”"
body: "The historian James McPherson released his survey of the Civil War era, Battle Cry of Freedom, in 1988. Despite its 900 pages of girth, the book was an overnight success and shared the 1989 Pulitzer Prize in History with Taylor Branch’s equally mammoth Parting the Waters.\nNamed for the Civil War-era song that they used to sing I guess\nI came to it early in the pandemic when, faced with dwindling in-home activities, I nearly engineered a Kurswechsel into full Civil War buff. There’s yet time for that, but more recently I turned again to the book and found some delightful tidbits.\nThe book opens, as it says, “at midcentury,” and McPherson takes you on an albatross’ tour of the country’s development. The famous Jacksonian market economy is detailed, as is the pace of western expansion. The narrative voice alights right around the time of the Mexican War, when a Pennsylvania Congressman named David Wilmot hurls a lit match into the political tinderbox that was arguments over statehood in the time of slavery.\nWilmot’s Proviso was a BFD\nFrom there, it’s all downhill – Lincoln’s election is for McPherson the “Revolution of 1860,” secession and Fort Sumter the “Counterrevolution of 1861”. Much emphasis is given to the reception of military outcomes in the home territories; dispatches from Birmingham or Atlanta or New York or Philadelphia newspapers give color to the political goings-on behind the front lines.\n1862, as McPherson details, was a banner year for the Union, especially in the Kentucky and Tennessee campaigns. From Cairo, the town memorialized in Huck Finn as the riparian entrance to the Old South, Army forces stabbed into the belly of the Confederacy.\nThere’s not a lot of illustrations from Huck Finn, which strikes me as odd\nU.S. Grant made his name at Forts Henry and Donelson, redoubts along the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, where he along with Andrew Foote mounted a coordinated land-water invasion. A commander named John Floyd, who had previously brought scandal to his name by going out of his way to restock Southern armories as Buchanan’s Secretary of War in full view of the coming crisis, was meant to be the Union’s prize, but he escaped overnight. So too did a profiteering battalion commander named Nathan Bedford Forrest, who decided mere hours before Fort Donelson’s surrender to slip out with his force across the icy Cumberland.\nCharacters abound in McPherson’s telling, and they’re all sketched in hokey, memorable ways. Charles Ellet, who built an impressive ramming squadron in the fresh-water Union navy through 1861 and 1862, was “doughty” and “frail-looking,” but died a glorious death in the Battle of Memphis. The “most intrepid of all” Union sailors, David Farragut, is “angry as a hornet” mid-battle. A Confederate war council at Fort Donelson was filled with “the self-important Tennessee politician Gideon Pillow, and the darkly handsome, saturnine West Pointer Simon Bolivar Buckner”. Incredibly, Buckner’s son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., was the highest-ranking officer killed in World War II.\nThe battles ebb and flow across the long years, and some of the keenest observation McPherson brings is in charting the evolution of military strategy and tactics. The situation at Vicksburg was basically frozen by the summer of 1862 – the last stand of the Confederacy on the Mississippi, it would take the Union army over a year before Grant’s daring campaign of maneuvers successfully took the city. Generals like Henry Halleck and George McClellan retarded the successful persecution of the war with old-timey beliefs – McPherson calls him “Jominian,” a reference to the noted war theorist Antoine-Henri Jomini, whose book on war crystallized the lessons of the Napoleonic Era. Part of Lincoln’s great strategic wisdom was to know that these beliefs were outdated, and part of Grant’s success was the way he threw the Jominian playbook out.\nOf course, perhaps the most notable change on the battlefield in the Civil War was the invention of ironclads, naval warships as we know them today which did not in fact exist before 1861. The CSS Virginia absolutely shredded the Union’s old ships of the line in its debut engagement at Hampton Roads. Remarkably, the Union was able to launch its first ironclad, the USS Monitor, the next day, and the two fought to an historic standstill. When the Union army was able to capture the city of Hampton Roads not too much later, the greyshirts blew the Virginia up so as to avoid its capture; the Monitor was sunk in a storm not too much later.\nMore to come as I dip in and out of its old thing. A Civil War guy I may yet become."
