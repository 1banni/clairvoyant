    title: "Notes on Atlantic-World Painting from a Visit to the National Gallery of Art",
    body: "Three capable men dominated and defined English painting in the high period of the Hanoverian kings. These were Thomas Gainsborough, Joseph Wright of Derby, and Joshua Reynolds, later knighted by George III.\nGainsborough was the pleasing painter to the nouveau riche, remembered best today for his gauzy, pastoral paintings of figures like Mr and Mrs Andrews. Sniffing at London society from his comfortable workshop in Bath, he painted the upper class and their families with an unceasing industry. Signs of this you can see in two paintings a few rooms apart in the National Gallery's collection - although the portraits are gorgeous and done with the masterly care that made him famous, the backgrounds are essentially identical, anticipatory in a perverse way of the scroll-mechanism backgrounds of late 20th century department store family portraiture.\nReynolds was London's favorite, a man who hobnobbed with leading lights of the age like Adam Smith, Dr Samuel Johnson, and James Boswell. Steady, focused compositions of courtly figures were his watchword. Joseph Wright, remembered with the strange moniker \"of Derby,\" innovated in the depiction of science. Whether in clinics or cozy hearths, Wright's learned men exhibited the newfound principles of physics and anatomy in exquisite detail.\nThe acme of their common achievements came in 1768 when Reynolds and his circle in London successfully petitioned the King for a charter to create the Royal Society. Kindly, Reynolds invited Gainsborough to become a founding member as well, although he was slighted by being out of Zoffany's depiction of the initial class.\nWhen the three of them passed on in the last decade of the eighteenth century, they left in their place a vacuum which would come to be filled by two new competing forces - the neoclassicism of the Americans and the romanticism of their young fellow countrymen. \nAmerican painting emerges from the Revolutionary period with a surprising degree of strength. Shedding its \"naive\" period, a style whose formal qualities gave it a look that remains odd today, the greatest of the new generation of painters in the early republic sang the new nation from bottom to top. Gilbert Stuart and John Trumbull painted the founding fathers in warm reds surrounded by fascia and other appurtenances of Roman descent, a motivic language they could speak to other Atlantic-world court painters in the age of revolutions, certainly to men no less than David in France.\nBy contrast the new Englishmen took their cues from the continent, where the nation's focus was trained for the better part of three decades after 1793. In gloomy Brandenburg, Goethe and Schiller and Friedrich put together brooding, agony-filled works of art in a style called the Romantic, and painters like John Constable and JMW Turner took to this with ferocity. Turner is the exemplar, something like a prophet of the modern, his swirling seascapes breaking the geometry of reality to emphasize the inescapable tempest of nascent industrial life. Pat scenes of ships-o'-the-line in combat off Brest became in his hands transcendental tableaux; a railroad crossing the Thames opens a portal to the future in Dionysian mystery, bursting the door open wide for Wassily Kandinsky and Georges Braque, whose hearts we can understand as our own.\nAn evolutionary missing link is presented by the work of John Martin, who was born after the death of Sir Reynolds. His painting below, Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still Upon Gibeon, struck me when I saw it while younger and still does so today. If we need to give it labels, it mixes history and landscape painting on an epic scale \- depictions of triumph are old as dirt, but the panache Martin invests in his 5'x7' canvas (which is huge!) sets this apart.\nLightning and hail strike the fleeing Canaanites while epic ziggurats look on smooth and petrified. The sun and moon spill unnatural amounts of light in their own corners of the painting, leaving the rest of the scene shadowed, which imparts to the viewer the feeling of watching a show during an eclipse.\nMartin's biblical architecture wouldn't feel out of place in the megalomania of Fritz Lang, a comparison of artists perhaps not as far off as it might seem \- Martin was disdained even in his own time for an overweening sentimentality, a dedication to a sort of Sir Walter Scott-esque arc of history which others around him found merely jejune.\nI like Martin, and I like Gainsborough and all the rest of the people who made their living putting oil to canvas. We miss their scale of interpretation and their care for the details. David Lynch said that he got into filmmaking in order to make paintings that moved, but we're not making many more Lynches these days.",

    title: "Local Notes No. 8 - The Prehistory of Seattle's Climate Pledge Arena",
    body: "In the 1995-96 NBA season, Gary Payton, point guard for Seattle's SuperSonics, did something remarkable - in addition to recording a box score of 19 points, 7 assists, and 4 rebounds per game, he punished lollygagging opponents by stealing the ball 231 times in the regular season. For this effort he earned the nickname The Glove; by the by he was also awarded Defensive Player of the Year.\nPayton's teammates, rallied by his monster effort on both sides of the floor, pitched in as well and ended up winning 68 games. This streak they continued in the playoffs to become Western Conference champions. Despite having such formidable accessory weaponry as Detlef Schrempf and a 20/2/11 Shawn Kemp available at veteran coach George Karl's disposal, Seattle never got to celebrate ultimate glory - as was the case with most NBA success stories in the 1990s, Payton's Sonics ran into the brick wall of Michael Jordan's Bulls, who put them away 4-2 in the league finals to begin their second threepeat.\nThe Sonics earned well over half of those 68 wins at a stadium then doing business for the first season under a new name - KeyArena, named for the venerable Midwestern regional depositary KeyBank, whose $15.1 million bid for the naming rights satisfied Seattle mayor Norm Rice's long-held dreams for a state-of-the-art pro sports facility in the Emerald City. (Until last month, Rice had been Seattle's only black elected mayor - Bruce Harrell just became the second.) In fact, while mayor Rice's architects were busy renovating the KeyArena-in-waiting, Payton's Sonics were briefly ousted from Seattle, playing instead at a PNW motorist's favorite landmark, the TacomaDome, some 30 miles to the south.\nTwo-time Seattle Mayor Norm Rice overseeing the groundbreaking of the new City Hall in 2001. Source: HistoryLink\nIn the 27 seasons before 1994, the SuperSonics played their home games at the same arena, then named simply the Coliseum. It finished construction in 1964 under the watchful eyes of Paul Thiry, who had a slightly scaled-down version built two years prior for the 1962 Seattle World's Fair; the Space Needle was first unveiled for the same occasion.\nThe Coliseum undergoing construction in 1961, ahead of the Seattle World's Fair. Source: Issuu\nThe Beatles performed twice at the Coliseum to crowds of 14,000; three other professional sports franchises played there; it hosted the NBA's All-Star Weekend in 1987, and future Sonics vanquisher Michael Jordan won his first dunk contest there.\nFive years after the best moment KeyArena had yet had, the Sonics' Game 5 win over the Bulls on a Friday in June of 1996, ownership of the team transferred to local nincompoop Howard Schultz, then CEO of Starbucks and lately a presidential pretender. The coffee mogul went to Seattle City Council a few years later hoping to have the renovation costs of KeyArena publicly defrayed; when this attempt at financial hardball failed, he sold the team to a willing gaggle of oil and gas enthusiasts of Oklahoman extraction.\nWhat follows is famous - Aubrey McClendon, who pioneered fracking and founded Chesapeake Energy, an entity solely responsible for 1 in every 1000 lbs of industrial greenhouse gases emitted in the thirty years following 1988, shanghaied the Sonics to Oklahoma City. They became the Thunder, and Kevin Durant became the last NBA player ever drafted in Seattle.\nOklahoma City Thunder part owner Aubrey McClendon dies in car crash after  indictment\nThe Fracking King himself, who met an untimely end in 2016 (Chevy Tahoe, concrete pillar). Source: ESPN\nPerhaps you get the point I'm trying to make by now; if not, a dash more history brings us to the present. With no regular tenant, the building born for a World's Fair fell into disrepair. KeyBank declined to renew their naming rights in 2011, but with no suitors on offer, the arena continued to go by the bank's title, like some Austenite waif doomed to marry her parents' first choice. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman sniffed at the possibility of an expansion team calling it home. The NBA simply ignored the prospect.\nBy 2016, however, conditions in Seattle had changed sufficiently to admit a second life for the pyramid. Now-disgraced but then-mayor Ed Murray, approaching reelection, made KeyArena's revitalization a pet project; when he resigned the following year, his replacement, Jenny Durkan, brought the campaign across the finish line. A contractor was selected in 2017 - the NHL joined negotiations the following week - and by late 2018, the lurid powers-that-be of the hockey world had granted Seattle their Kraken. The NBA, never unhappy to join a party, sent the stadium off for extensive renovation with a preseason exhibition game between Durant's new team, the Golden State Warriors, and the hapless Sacramento Kings - Durant scored 26 points to win.\nhttps://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jhZD2oYyCjI?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\nWhile Murray-Durkan opportunism was certainly one driver of KeyArena's rehab, the other was likely more impactful. For by 2017, Seattle's homegrown corporate Cthulhu du jour, Amazon, had swallowed up half of the e-commerce market. Financial commentator Jim Cramer that same year included the company in his coining of the acronym FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) to describe the technology powerhouses whose soaring valuations would propel equity markets to their dizzying heights in the Trump era.\nThe Amazon Spheres in South Lake Union, Seattle. (I think the Spheres are cool fwiw). Source: CNBC\nSuch prowess had given Jeff Bezos, Amazon's boss, dreams of grandeur; finding time away from his philanthropic, romantic, and extraterrestrially avionic efforts, he sent a trunk of ducats down Mercer St and asked if the city would be so kind as to begin referring to the Seattle Center Arena (neé KeyArena (neé Coliseum)) as the Climate Pledge Arena.",

    title: "Local Notes No. 7 - 'Iolani Palace, the US' Only Royal Residence",
    body: "The most famous examples of Hawaiian architecture are often identified with the somewhat tropical strain of modernism that infected the islands in the postwar boom. This makes a natural degree of sense: after all, statehood and Elvis arrived in the îles Sandwiches at the zenith of the Jet Age, when PanAm established a new tourist mecca in Waikiki and the Rat Pack could be found sipping mai-tais at the bar of the Coco Palms Resort.\nImage may contain Summer Plant Palm Tree Arecaceae Tree Building Architecture and Tropical\nOn a recent visit, though, I was equally drawn to the fine buildings constructed before annexation. The Bishop Museum's Hawaiian Hall, built in 1889 by the firm of William F. Smith (about whom the building's application for status in the National Register of Historic Places says \"little is known\"), was one of the most striking.\nThe Hawaiian Hall of the Bishop Museum.\nIntended as a monument to the last member of the Kamehameha dynasty, Princess Bernice Pauahi, it's a beautiful example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, whose elements Philadelphians may have a leg up in recognizing - I found it reminiscent of Frank Furness' buildings, like the PAFA or Penn's Fisher Fine Arts Library.\nThe 4-story Main Reading Room acts as a lightwell for the inner rooms surrounding it.\nThe unbeatable Fisher Fine Arts Library. Source: Wiki\nStill more striking was the 'Iolani Palace, the only royal palace ever built on US soil. Its construction began five years into the reign of King Kalākaua, on the last day of 1879. Over the course of the next three years, three architects would see the palace to completion - Thomas Baker put together the blueprints and his handiwork formed its final design, but he was sacked and moved to Australia in 1880, really just a few weeks after ground was broken. Charles Wall shipped in from a San Francisco racked by the economic spasms of the Panic of 1873 to continue the work, but he couldn't please Kalākaua either, which left the otherwise unknown Isaac Moore to finish the job.\nThe Palace is undoubtedly handsome. Its masonry glimmers beige and heather green in understated contrast to the joyful bounty of its surrounding grounds. The structure sports mansard roofs in the Second Empire style and fine Corinthian columns supporting broad verandas (lana'i) fronting both floors.\nIolani Palace - MASON\nA gazebo on the southwestern corner, which still stands today, was built for Kalākaua's coronation ceremony in 1883; other records from the kingdom period show the palace's frequent ritual and ceremonial usage.\nThe gazebo decorated for the 1883 coronation.\nOne rather ignominious ceremony the Palace was host to took place in 1898 - this was the annexation of Hawai'i by the United States, against the explicit protestation of the country's rightful sovereign, the Queen Lili'uokalani. Marines from the USS Philadelphia decked out in their whites let down Kamehameha's standard and rose the American flag in its place. Inside, the ex-Queen, confined to house arrest since the coup of 1893, waited and waited.\nRaising the American flag at 'Iolani Palace.\nThe American annexation of 1898 brought an end to a century of independent dynastic rule by native Hawaiians of Hawai'i, a remarkable achievement comparable to the defenses against colonialism achieved by Thailand or Ethiopia in other periods. Kamehameha the Great, until his late 40s nothing more than one chief among chiefs on the Big Island, waged a series of wars to consolidate power beginning in the 1790s, ending in success and unification under his rule around 1810.1\nKing Kamehameha Statue, Oahu | Go Hawaii\nThomas Gould's statue of Kamehameha the Great stands across from 'Iolani on the grounds of the State Supreme Court. A replica stands in the US Capitol. Source: GoHawaii\nHis successor, Kamehameha II, nearly fumbled the bag on a trip to Britain - an anglophile tradition persisted in the kings of Hawai'i for several generations - but from what the record suggests, threat of the paperwork that would have ensued, as well as Kamehameha II's untimely death from tuberculosis in London in 1824, dissuaded the British Foreign Office from outright conquering the islands and so they went on a sovereign nation in the north Pacific.\nKamehameha III faced down another British annexation attempt in 1843 and reshaped the government into a constitutional monarchy with strong rule of law. Kalākaua dramatically revamped the economy by entering into a free trade deal with the US, leading to an economic boom which attracted American business interests. When Lili'uokalani attempted to rejigger the balance of political power in the kingdom with the promulgation of the Constitution of 1893, those same interests - notably including Samuel Dole, cousin to pineapple mogul James Dole - forcibly overthrew the monarchy.\nQueen Liliuokalani leaves Aliiolani Hale, 1/14/1893\nQueen Lili'uokalani leaving Ai'iolani Hale, now the State Supreme Court, just across King St from 'Iolani Palace, after announcing the new Constitution.

President Grover Cleveland thought the whole thing a miscarriage of justice and refused the coup plotters' petitions for immediate annexation; the now Republic of Hawai'i could only then muddle along for a few years, in which intervening time a monarchist party led an abortive restoration attempt, until William McKinley could be elected President, after which the coming of American imperialism was proudly, irrevocably declared in the bowels of the USS Maine.\nSanford Ballard Dole -- Elected Legislator and Appointed Supreme Court  Justice of the Kingdom of Hawaii; President of the Provisional Government  and of the Republic of Hawaii; Governor of the Territory of\nSanford Dole inaugurated as first Governor of the Territory of Hawaii at 'Iolani Palace, 1898.

Indeed, Lili'uokalani, last queen of this magnificent monument to an independent, modern nation-state built atop mere earthen toeholds of volcanism 3000 miles away from the nearest continent, fittingly composed a song of farewell which later came to stand metonymically for the American takeover and all it meant for Hawaii: Aloha 'Oe.",

    title: "A Visitor's Guide to A Coruña, Spain",
    body: "I was delighted last week to be able to spend time in A Coruña, a seaside city in Galicia, Spain's northwestern-most province. Galicia has long suffered from a dearth of attention, especially in comparison to Spain's nearly mythic Mediterranean coast, from Barcelona on down; and despite lying just 100mi from the border with Portugal, A Coruña did not receive the bump in attention paid to Porto, Lisbon, and the Algarve when travel to the Lusophone Atlantic coast of Iberia came into vogue.\nWith this post, then, I'm going to try and make amends. This will be a by-the-books travel guide to A Coruña, including how to get there, where to stay, and what to do while you're there. I had a blast with my time and I think you will too.\nOverview\nA Coruña lies in the northwest of Galicia, itself the northwest of Spain. Together with its suburbs, the city boasts a total population of about 400,000 - in US terms, its size is comparable to that of Asheville, NC, Santa Barbara, CA, or even Anchorage, AK.\nIts weather and environs hew much more closely to the cities of the Pacific Northwest, which is why in the subhed I called it \"Spain's Portland\" (and I mean Portland, OR); it's intermittently rainy and cloudy a lot of the time, but rarely stormy or snowy, and heat in summer is softened by the breeze from the ocean.\nA Coruña seen looking southeast from the ocean - the Tower of Hercules is at bottom-left, Riazor Beach middle-right. Source: Galiciatips.com\nMuch of the city lies on a peninsula which extends into a leeward bay known as the Ría da Coruña - opposite the city across the bay lies Ferrol, once an important shipbuilding town. The Ría da Coruña is exemplary of the geography of littoral Galicia, with the verdant coastal land rising rather steeply and irregularly from sea level to form the surrounding hills and dales. Rías like this can be found elsewhere in the world - they are basically the same as Scandinavian fjords, with quibbles over whether glacier action carved the landscape - but were named for the first time on the Galician coast.\nIf population totals don't mean much to you, I'll add that the city feels bigger in terms of geography and smaller in terms of population than it seems. Taking in the sights required several 20k+ step count days, but in my time there I ran into a few repeat customers, including one lovely doña who introduced her 17-year-old dog and informed me it was her cat's birthday the next Sunday, then showed me a picture of said birthday when I saw her at the cafe Monday.\nThe city's name - A Coruña - may look odd to those familiar with Spanish, but that is because it is given in Galician, a Spanish dialect closer to Portuguese. To get its name in Spanish, simply switch the A for La. Since the democratic transition, the government in Galicia has promoted the use of their dialect, also called gallego. However, this should not be cause for alarm on the traveler's part: everyone in the city speaks perfectly normal (and very clear, I thought) Castilian Spanish, and almost everyone speaks better English than your Spanish anyway.\nHistory, Deep and Recent, and Current State\nDeep History\nIn his excellent The Celts: A Very Short Introduction, Cambridge archaeologist Barry Cunliffe challenges us to rethink our familiar notions of European geography:\nA glance at the map of Europe, suitably adjusted to jolt our cognitive geography, is sufficient to stress that Atlantic Europe is a cohesive region. Its many promontories and peninsulas are linked by the ocean, while the flooded valleys of its ria coastlines provide sheltered waters reaching deep inland. The great rivers of France and Iberia flowing westwards into the ocean are arteries of communication binding huge swathes of inland territory to the littoral zone.\nCunliffe, The Celts\nCunliffe focuses on Atlantic Europe as the natural homeland of the Celts, an ancient people who lived down from the Algarve in Portugal through Galicia and French Bordeaux and Brittany all the way up to Ireland and Wales. This ancient cross-European cultural continuity gets some play in Galicia today - souvenir shops sell emblems and necklaces with goofy \"Celtic symbols\" to tourists - but the region's Celtic roots are much less important to its history than what came after.\nWhat - or rather who - came after was Julius Caesar and the Romans. Caesar came to A Coruña in 62 BC and established trade in iron with France and England around the Bay of Biscay, a pattern of intercultural communication which would repeat endlessly through Galician history. In the second century, Roman imperial administrators under Trajan or somelike set about building a nice big lighthouse at the end of the peninsula of Coruña - this is the Tower of Hercules, which stands today and is therefore the oldest extant lighthouse in the world.\nThe band of stone wrapping a helix up the tower is evidence of the old spiral ramp used to scale it, now lost.\nAfter Rome, A Coruña's status as a rich and well-connected coastal city opened it up for intermittent invasion by the Vikings, while its Romano-Iberian neighbors to the south fell eventually to the great conquest of Al-Andalus perpetrated by the Umayyads.\nBy the early 800s the kings of Asturias had reestablished a beachhead of Christian rule in northern Spain, including Galicia. Then around 814, Alfonso II (there would be eleven more Alfonsos ruling Spain) learned that some peasants had found bones supposedly belonging to Saint James the Greater, one of Jesus' Apostles. Seizing upon the opportunity to up his status as a defender of Christendom, Alfonso II affirmed the identity of the remains and declared that a great cathedral be built on its site - this became the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, and the pilgrimage to it the Camino de Santiago.\nSantiago di Compostela Jubilee: A time of grace, healing and encounter -  Vatican News\nWhile Coruña was not the ultimate destination of the Camino, the Camino changed it as well. Pilgrims on the Camino came from all Christendom as part of a large network of pilgrimages active in the High Middle Ages - Ken Follett's indescribably popular 1989 novel, The Pillars of the Earth, dramatizes this well in one of its later chapters. But most of those pilgrims ended up coming from France, and the development of the overland routes of travel through northern Spain influenced Coruña and Galicia greatly. Monasteries sprouted up all over Galicia and grew rich and powerful from the income of the pilgrims; the monks began to grow wine, leading to the division of varietals handed down to us today.\nGalicia Spain Wine Map\nDrank a lot of lovely Ribeira Sacra on this trip. Source: Wine Scholar Guild.\nThe resumption of cross-cultural communication in Galicia in the High Middle Ages would deal a nasty sting to the region as we turn to the early modern; the Black Death arrived in Iberia at Galicia, via those Biscay-based water routes established by the Romans. But for all the suffering the Galicians survived in the 1400s, the birth of empire in the 1500s led to better times. The Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, built their Royal Audiencia in Coruña, and their successor Carlos I (Charles V to his subjects in the Holy Roman Empire) established one of his Casas de la Contratación in the city as well, this one devoted to the spice trade.\nThe Spanish Armada departed from Ferrol in 1588. After that lucky storm wrecked it, Francis Drake raided Coruña in retribution in 1589, but was repelled thanks in part to the efforts of a brave woman known as Maria Pita, whose name adorns the city's main square today.\nPlaza Maria Pita and the Royal Audiencia established by Ferdinand and Isabella. Source: me!\nRecent History\nWhen Napoleon invaded Spain in the Peninsular Wars, the Coruñeros fought back again, this time aided by the British. The 1809 Battle of Corunna was a Dunkirk moment 130 years before the one we know today in Normandy took place, as 26,000 British troops out of an expeditionary force of 35,000 escaped back to their ships in the Bay of Biscay. Sir John Moore, commander of the British forces in Spain, was wounded and died in Coruña; the Jardin San Carlos in the city's Marina is devoted to him.\nFast forwarding a bit more, Francisco Franco was born in Ferrol in 1892. He would go on to lead the Right in the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939, after which he would rule Spain singlehandedly for 36 more years. Franco took as his country home the Pazo de Meirás in the hills outside Coruña; oddly enough, that specific home had previously belonged to one of Spain's most celebrated modern novelists, Emilia Pardo Bazan, who was born there into a noble Coruñero family in 1851.\nAfter the transition to democracy, Galicia was promoted to the status of autonomous community, making it co-equal to Catalonia, Andalusia, the Basque Country, etc. The local government has since promoted the use of Galician, which is why you'll see it on signs and hear it on the street occasionally.\nCurrent State\nA Coruña was changed immeasurably in 1975, when Amancio Ortega opened up his first Zara in the city center. Since then, Zara has grown to be the flagship chain of Inditex, Ortega's conglomerate and the world's largest apparel retailer. Inditex's 100bn Euro valuation is good enough to make Ortega the world's 11th richest man.\nInditex dominates the region's economy. Its headquarters, in rural Arteixo, employs 5,000 designers who are shuttled out from the city daily. You can't go more than a couple blocks without seeing one Inditex store or another, including its crown jewel, the Zara flagship, which lies at the intersection of the Calle de Sanchez Bregua and the Calle Compostela, one block from the ocean.\nEPR Retail News | SPAIN: Zara opens flagship store on calle Compostela 3,  one of A Coruña's prime shopping streets\nInterior of the 5-story Zara flagship - menswear on floor 5.\nZara brought modernity and industry to the city, attracting designers and models from all over the world, who went on to demand big-city amenities. Couture boutiques like Iamnue Store sprung up in its wake, as did fine dining of various cuisines, helping diversify the Galician diet away from its traditional reliance on mariscos.\nTienda de Ropa Iamnue Store en A Coruña\nImagine if you could buy Comme des Garçons and Acne Studios in York, PA. That's what Coruña is like.\nThis novel modernity has made A Coruña a very lively place. Professionals of all stripes walk its streets and crowd its bars alongside Erasmus students from across Europe. If there's a baby bust plaguing modern Spain, you couldn't tell by looking at Coruña - almost every young couple I saw had a baby in tow, and the playground of the Plaza Pontevedra in the city center was filled daily with shouts of playing kids.\nLife is good in A Coruña, which also engenders a certain chill among its inhabitants. People were very happy indeed to spend their days at big restaurant tables, taking cañas of Estrella Galicia or bumming out on their lovely beaches like Riazor or Santa Caterina. For travelers more accustomed to the haughty monuments of Madrid or the sun-drenched Mediterranean coast, A Coruña's different pace of life has a lot to offer.\nGetting There\nA Coruña has a small airport with mostly-daily flights to Madrid and Barcelona - according to Expedia, you can even get there from London-Gatwick.\nIf you've got the time, though, take the train. There are about 5 daily trains from Madrid's Chamartin Station to Coruña via Renfe, the national rail operator. The journey takes 5-6 hours and lets you soak in the varied geography of Spain while also going through other Galician cities like Ourense and Santiago.\nSights to See\nCiudad Vieja\nLarge, pedestrian neighborhood entirely paved by cobblestones and hemmed in by tall townhouses which emerge occasionally into breathtakingly peaceful courtyards. Reminiscent of Venice in its breadth - you could spend your entire stay here.\nPlaza Maria Pita\nLarge broad plaza at the narrow northern end of the isthmus, home to the Royal Audiencia established by the Catholic Monarchs. The statue at middle commemorates Maria Pita, a Coruñera who assisted in the defense of the city against the marauding British under the command of Francis Drake.\nEl Ayuntamiento en la Plaza de Maria Pita - Picture of La Coruna, Province  of A Coruna - Tripadvisor\nMarina\nThe best place in the city to see examples of A Coruña's characteristic architectural motif - the galerias, facade-wide bay windows which imitate the aft walls of large galleys.\nZona del PARROTE hacia la ciudad vieja de La Coruña desde el puerto  deportivo. - Photo de La Corogne, Province of A Coruna - Tripadvisor\nRiazor Beach\nBeach on the western side of the isthmus, facing the ocean. At low tide quite rocky, but no less beautiful.\nMonte San Pedro\nLarge park on the hilltop to the southwest of city center - can be accessed via taxi or via a cool funicular which takes you to a big observatory. Great restaurant up there too.\nFile:Ascensor ó monte San Pedro, A Coruña.jpg - Wikimedia Commons\nTower of Hercules\nAlready mentioned, but site of the oldest extant lighthouse in the world, built by the Romans in the early part of the first millennium. Lovely park surrounding it, with the compass rose of the Celts and a statue of a Celtic king.\nRiazor Stadium\nHome to Real Club Deportivo La Coruña, the city's soccer team, which plays currently in the fourth league. At one time (2005) they were actually good enough to win La Liga championship, but people love them regardless and I'm sure catching a game there would be a tremendous experience.\nStadium Guide: Estadio Riazor, Deportivo La Coruna\nEstrella Galicia Museum\nThe Museo Estrella Galicia (MEGA) is a baffling thing - an absolute corporate narcissism and meticulously detailed and curated museum of the history of beer at the same time. At one point, a theme park ride puts you inside a vat of barley as you become hops. The 25 euro ticket is worth it for all the free beer at the end, but this is a long tour.\nMuseums\nThe Museo de las Bellas Artes da Coruña was very well-equipped, with a great selection of portraits from the 16th century up to the modern era. Also had a lovely collection just of Goya sketches. Other museums focus on Pablo Picasso, who spent his adolescence in the city.\nChurches\nThe Colegiata de Santa María del Campo, located behind Plaza Maria Pita, dates back to the 12th century, which is sort of incredible in its own right. Otherwise go for the Parroquia de San Jorge, which is about 100 years younger.\nEating and Drinking\nAs an addendum to this section, I've put all these great bars and restaurants in a Google Map, available for viewing here.\nBakeries, cafes and fruterías\nEvery block in A Coruña has its own bakery and its own frutería. While there are supermarkets, people rely on these local shops for their fresh goods, and how fresh they are. Upscale bakeries like Tahona offer truly scrumptious treats with the Scandinavian industrial-chic design affectation a New York-based traveler might already be homesick for.\nSome of my favorite cafes: Tahona, Vazva, Cafe Central Park, Astro Coffee, Cafe Siboney\nPanadería Tahona inaugura un nuevo establecimiento en la Ciudad Escolar de  A Coruña\nSeafood\nCab drivers in Madrid on the way to the train will tell you to eat the seafood in Galicia, and they're not wrong. All of it's good, but try taking the little tapas camarones at Os Tigres on Calle Galera. Very lovely.\nSome of my favorites: A Mundiña, NaDo, Peculiar, Gastromaar, Terreo Cocina Casual\nBars\nLike I said earlier, there are a lot of kids and students in A Coruña, and they will absolutely mob bars along Calle Juan Canalejo basically every night of the week. Bars tend to close at 1am but there are clubs, lines for which you'll see begin to form as the street-fronts close up.\nSome of my favorites: Twin Fin, La Maleta, La Tata, Abuela Josefa, Kvras\nPUNTOS DE RUMBA | Rumba is good\nOtherwise\nIf you're hungry for some other cuisines, I had great Thai at KohLanta, great ramen at Monkee Ramen, and great poke and sushi at Restaurante Samyo in Quatro Caminos.\nShopping and city life\nCoruñeros shop for clothes like Americans shop for gadgets - when in Rome, do as the Romans and go shopping!\nDefinitely try the Inditex complex - any of the several Zaras, the Massimo Dutti, Pull & Bear, and Bershkas available in city center all fantastic.\nBoutiques in city center are great as well, and it's fun shopping at the David in the relationship when Goliath is worth 100bn Euros.\nIt's worth heading for Marineda City, the giant mall built on the city outskirts in 2011. If you're dying for it, they've got the region's only McDonalds and Starbucks.\nCoruñeros also prioritize chilling\nSiesta is pretty well-adhered to most days - don't try and go shopping or out to eat between 2pm and 5pm\nPlaza Pontevedra always has kids screaming and skateboarding thanks to the Colegio which fronts it. Otherwise, Plaza Maria Pita is gorgeous, as are the Plaza de Galicia and Plaza de España. For a nice day trip, try going to Santa Cristina Beach in Oleiros.",

    title: "Local Notes No. 5 - Fort Ross, the Frontier Outpost of Russian America",
    body: "Heading west from Santa Rosa, CA, out along the Russian River, there runs thirty miles of charming, bucolic country: a thick canopy of trees and hills and small towns with names like Rio Nido, Guerneville, Monte Rio, Jenner. Eventually, the canopy thins, the sea comes and you can go no more west, so follow the road and turn north - what will then open before you is the Sonoma Coast, an area of unbelievable beauty. Describing its vistas defies the words normally used for this kind of thing - dramatic, yes; stunning, yes; but even more than that, jarring and vertiginous and almost deadly.\nSonoma Coast | The Lodge at Sonoma\nIt can get foggy - bring a jacket.\nNew Deal funds led to the construction of a highway along the seaside in 1933. When I drove on it this summer, the good people of the California Dept of Transportation were hard at work shoring up its asphalt against the encroaching seaside. But long before these roads were laid down, before prospectors struck gold and before San Francisco became the Paris of the Pacific, a different, almost alien set of eyes took in the sight of this beautiful coastline - Russian ones.\nIn 1812, a shipful of Russians landed at an inlet they named Rumiantsev Bay, in honor of the empire's Minister of Commerce at the time, the Count Rumiantsev, and founded an agricultural settlement they named Fort Ross. The expedition's leader was one Ivan Kuskov, previously a paper-pusher at the Russian-American Company, the startup enterprise given royal imprimatur in 1799 to fortify the Russian presence in what was rapidly becoming a race between Britain, Spain, and the sixteen-year-old USA for control of northwestern North America.\n(I will take the time here to note that my little note about Russian colonization of Northern California is not designed to downplay the lives and experiences of Native peoples who lived in the area before, during, and after the Russian presence. The presence of imperial Russian traders in California is notable for their complete foreignness, both then and now, as well as the ways in which they tried to make up for that foreignness. However, I would be not doing my part if I didn't mention that there were large and active indigenous populations in these regions all along.)\nONLINE EXCLUSIVE: Russia Got Into Its Own \"Folly\" in Alaska\nDetail from a painting depicting Alaskan natives watching a departing Russian-American company ship.\nEven before the Tsar's ukase of 1799, Russians had crossed the Bering Strait in explorations mostly aimed after the economic object of nearly all tsarist expansion from time immemorial - fur pelts. From Ivan the Terrible on down, each tsar in turn sought more virgin forest to harvest yet more furs from the chicest of sources - beavers, sea-otters, sables, ermines, and even squirrels. This long process of Russian eastern expansion suffers from underdiscussion in the broader history of European colonization - although it never involved daring man-o-wars crossing oceans to find new shores, to the Siberians they encountered, the tsarist troops and profiteers were unstoppable marauders, forging their way with cannon and musket in a marshy semi-tundra whose sparse native populations, be they Tatar, Kirgiz, Samoyed, or Yakut, had before mostly concerned themselves with fighting each other.\nRussian eastern expansion from the time of Ivan the Terrible on.\nBy the turn of the 18th century, imperial boots were planted firmly in what we still today call the Russian Far East, and so it was that in 1725, Peter the Great asked for his bravest sailors to test the waters east of Kamchatka for whatever fur-growing mammals might be found in the land across the strait. A few shipwrecks later, Russian traders had figured it out and were engaged in a brisk business from a port like Kamchatka or Okhotsk to the Alaskan mainland and the Aleutian islands and back. According to Gibson, one successful summer's hunt for pelts in the Aleutians could net between 10,000 and 30,000 rubles, doubling the money invested to outfit the expedition.\nThe capacity for such profit sparked a fur rush of sorts, with hundreds of voyages being launched from the middle of the century on. This had predictably tragic environmental consequences - otters were extinct in the Kuril Islands by 1780, and fading fast from the Aleutians by the next decade. In order to impose some discipline on the crush of trappers headed across the Bering, the Tsarina Catherine granted the first state licenses for otter hunting in the late 1780s, a system which was updated by her successor, Paul I, in his 1799 edict forming the Russian-American Company, which won the right to a strict monopoly on fur trading and bore the responsibility of creating more substantial settlements in North America.\nPaul's decision to grant the monopoly to the RAC represented a break from previous Russian imperial strategy and also marked the introduction of a dynamic form of corporate management - the joint-stock company. This new corporate form allowed individual shareholders the right to invest capital and own separate chunks of the business, as well as transfer those shares freely without impacting the existence or operations of the company. What's more, early practitioners of the joint-stock form figured out they could limit their liability to only capital invested, a development which essentially turned them into modern corporations as we understand them today. And although the Dutch and British had had wildly successful joint-stock companies operating colonial enterprises since the early 1600s, most notably in their respective East India Companies, Russian exploration had for two centuries neither birthed nor adopted the same organizational model.\nWhen they finally did, it allowed them to focus. Under the leadership of A.A. Baranov, the RAC founded two settlements, Pavlovskaya and Novo Arkhangelsk, which became the modern day cities of Kodiak and Sitka. After receiving intelligence that there were long stretches of the California coast to their south unoccupied by other imperial powers, Baranov dispatched his lieutenant, Kuskov, with instructions to leave some plaques claiming the land for the Tsar and also to set up camp and do some settling.\nWalking the well-maintained grounds (thanks, CA Parks & Rec) of Kuskov's krepost', I found myself wondering what these outcast Russians must've thought about the new landscape they found themselves in. Homesickness is written into the very planks of the structures they built - one of the most striking details at the amply sized fort is the small Orthodox cross hewn in soggy oak standing atop the church.\nThe Fort Ross church (right) and its little Orthodox cross, beating back the tides.\nOnly the higher-ups and visitors actually stayed within the fort walls - most other Russians lived in smaller houses just outside the fort, while the indigenous Kashaya people who were more populous and integral members of fort life lived in another village a short distance to the south.\nWhat did these people do all day? For starters, they didn't actually end up hunting much fur - beaver and otter populations plummeted too quickly wherever the Russian trappers went to set up a real business. By 1834, the RAC's leadership was so desperate to save something of their founding livelihood that they called for a twelve-year moratorium on all fur trapping and thereafter imposed a strict quota system.\nInstead, the colonists at Fort Ross turned their attention towards other economic activity - Kuskov was a gifted gardener, and established farms of grain and barley with minimal success, but also of grapes, peaches, and pears which were modestly more successful. The Russians figured out ranching as well, grazing herds all the way down the bay to where modern-day road-trippers like myself make the turn out from Jenner onto the coast. They even tried their hand at shipbuilding, assembling California's first windmill as part of a semi-industrial effort. This fizzed out after only a few attempts.\nTruth be told, it seems that the Russians at Fort Ross, and especially the RAC higher-ups there, spent most of their time waiting for company resupply ships and thinking of life back home. A French visitor in 1828, A.B. Duhaut-Cilly, noted astutely that, \"In the apartment of the governor are found all the conveniences valued by Europeans but still unknown in California.\"\nThe possessions and house of Alexander Rotchev, the Fort's last administrator, are still at the Fort today and in them you can see the truth of Duhaut-Cilly's observation. Rotchev and his family spared no expense in attempting to live on the Sonoma Coast like the genteel Europeans they thought themselves to be - they kept a score of Mozart on the piano at all times.\nThe Rotchev house, the only building still standing since the Russian period.\nLike any discerning Europeans of their time, the fort's higher-ups investigated their California surroundings with a scientific eye. The first vaccinations in California were reportedly done at the fort in 1821. The reports of one Captain Golovnin's stay at the Fort in 1818 include the first written mention of the native population intentionally burning large grasslands to inhibit future wildfires. Yegor Chernykh, a rancher at the Fort, kept systematic weather records for the first time beginning in 1837. Ilya Gavrilovich Voznesenskii, a friend of Chernykh's, left for a surveying trip in 1841 which led him eventually up the Sacramento River to the door of one unassuming miller named John Sutter.\nInattentive, however, to the pioneering exploits of their scientists in California, the Russian-American Company had decided by 1840 to call time on their outpost at Fort Ross. None of their attempts in hunting, farming, or industry had ever panned out, and by the late 1830s, they were spending some 40,000 rubles per year just to keep the colony afloat. Rotchev, the administrator, asked around if any of the surrounding great powers were interested in taking over for the Russians; when both the British and Mexicans declined, he went up the river and knocked on Mr. Sutter's door himself. After 30 years of trying, Tsarist Russia unceremoniously sold away its most distant outpost in North America to a miller better remembered today for the gold others found on his property and the rush it inspired. Rotchev and his patrician family got onto the same boat as the other hundred or so farmers, ranchers, and would-be shipworkers who called Fort Ross home and sailed for RAC headquarters at Sitka. Russian California was no more; before another 30 years were out, Russian America would be gone too, sold to the American government at William Seward's request in 1867 for $7 million.\nA lovely painting of Fort Ross, with all the drama of the Sonoma Coast on full display.\nWhat can we learn from the Russians' experience in California? Plenty, not least of which the important lesson that for all the incalculable transformation wrought by other colonial enterprises around the world, we have to remember that none of them were ever sure things, and indeed very many of them did fail. I wrote my senior thesis about another, earlier attempt by a German banking family to establish a pearl fishing colony in Venezuela - that one ended with everyone dying in the jungle, either from horrible disease or a machete to the head, so the Rotchev family was probably better off having just taken the long boat ride up to Alaska.\nAnother lesson is the variance in interactions between colonists and indigenous peoples: the cossacks who conquered Siberia swept over unprepared peoples with ease, while Baranov was a butcher of a colonist, slaughtering native Alaskans and building Sitka on the bones of a Tlingit town. By contrast, it seems that the colonists at Fort Ross like Kuskov and Rotchev worked hard to maintain cordial and mutually respectful relations with the Kashaya and other groups of indigenous people in the area. Some sources claim the indigenous groups even played their own imperial politics, preferring the Russian approach to the heavy-handed Spanish, and balancing one against the other.\nLastly, we can't forget about the environmental impacts of extractionary colonial economies - those extinct Kuril Islands otters aren't coming back - but nor should we pat ourselves too much on the back, lest we think we've got all the answers. The RAC tried moratoria and quotas beginning nearly 200 years ago. It will likely take more than that to save our fish.\nFort Ross is today an interesting curiosity and a great state park lying on one of the prettiest stretches of coastline on the planet, but for a quarter-century it was the nexus of imperial hopes and worries from Moscow to Sitka and including London, Washington, Paris, and Mexico City. Not bad, I say, in the end for a bunch of promyshlenniki.",

    title: "Review: Daniel Immerwahr, “How to Hide an Empire”",
    body: "In June of 1944, Dwight Eisenhower hesitated for cause of bad weather in crossing the English Channel and launching the Allied re-invasion of Nazi-controlled Europe.\nIn this he was following an example set some two millenia prior by Gaius Julius Caesar, at the time the scouring governor of Gaul, in both its Cis- and Transalpine flavors, and mighty Illyricum too.\nIn his own De Bello Gallico, Caesar described the approach to Britain:\nWhen about eighty transports — enough, in his opinion, to carry two legions across — had been collected and concentrated, he distributed all the ships of war he had over between his quartermaster-general, lieutenant-generals, and commandants. To the total stated eighteen transports should be added, which were detained eight miles off by the wind, and prevented from entering the port of concentration;​ these he allotted to the cavalry…\nThese arrangements made, he caught a spell of fair weather for sailing, and weighed anchor about the third watch; he ordered the cavalry to proceed to the further harbour, embark, and follow him. They took somewhat too long to despatch the business; he himself reached Britain about the fourth hour of the day, and there beheld the armed forces of the enemy displayed on all the cliffs.​ Such was the nature of the ground, so steep the heights which banked the sea, that a missile could be hurled from the higher levels on to the shore. Thinking this place to be by no means suitable for disembarkation, he waited at anchor till the ninth hour for the rest of the flotilla to assemble there.\nJulius Caesar, De Bello Gallico Book IV: 21-22\nTwenty centuries of progress could not deliver Ike good forecasts for the twenty miles of sea between Dover and Calais, but they could deliver him something nearly as useful: live real-time computer-based messaging with the other top brass.\nDaniel Immerwahr's language here is neat: \"Before the invasion of Normandy, George Marshall in Washington used a similar system to confer for more than an hour with Dwight Eisenhower in Europe, Douglas MacArthur in the Southwest Pacific, and John Deane in Moscow. The generals communicated by sending short typed messages, which appeared on a screen. In other words, they texted.\"\nTaken from George Raynor Thompson and Dixie R. Harris, The Signal Corps: The Outcome (Mid-1943 Through 1945). Office of the Chief of Military History, Washington DC: 1956.\nThis little contrivance is found in Immerwahr's 2019 tour de force history, How to Hide a Nation, in the portion of the book devoted to what he refers to as \"empire-killing technologies\". It's one of the many striking anecdotes he marshals to build an alert and lively argument concerning US imperialism, its impacts on the colonized around the world, and the striking lack of impact left on mainland citizens.\nImmerwahr's book received all the praise it deserved; the New York Times called it a best book of 2019. My review, then, is not only late, but also redundant, because I feel similarly to the other, quicker (some might call them professional) reviewers. Still, I hope to bring out a few more interesting morsels from this very well-constructed book.\nHide an Empire succeeds because it is principally not about the actual land grabs with which most people are familiar from an AP US history course, neither Teddy Roosevelt carving up the decrepit Spanish Caribbean nor Seward's folly.\nNo, Immerwahr did something bolder: he dared to bring us with him into the history of those new American lives and what the brutality of the 20th century visited upon them even as we mainlanders remained safe, two oceans away from the firestorm of it all.\nHow to Hide an Empire does what it says on the tin - it traces the capture of America's overseas territories, their development (or lack thereof) in the period leading up to World War II, the wartime experience, and the twin processes of either decolonization or true mainland integration (via statehood) which followed the war.\nIt is important, I think, that Hide an Empire is not only concerned with the titular empire-hiding, which takes place in the imperial period, but also in the birth of the American empire and in the surprising new form of American hegemony developed after decolonization.\nThis fullness upgrades the work from \"pretty good\" to \"great,\" offering no-nonsense mechanical narratives of how wartime advances in science and technology \"killed\" the empire, or at least the need for the American government to administer a set of overseas territories directly.\nLearning a bit of Immerwahr's background reveals the seed of research around which the rest of the book coalesced pretty plainly. His academic career at Berkeley and then Northwestern has been made in intellectual history, and his \"real historian\" bonafides are unimpeachable - his first book, Thinking Small: The United States and the Lure of Community Development, won the Organization of American Historians' 2016 award for best intellectual history.\nThat seed, then, must be somewhere in the tradition of American intellectual history, and indeed, some of the book's most interesting and novel arguments come in the discussion of mapmaking and cartography in early-20th c. America. The introduction to the book is subtitled \"Looking Beyond the Logo Map,\" Immerwahr's term for the cartographic depiction of the United States as merely the Lower 48, and a few chapters later he describes the impact of the successful end to the Spanish-American War on American cartography:\nTo McKinley…[there was] only one option: take the Philippines, 'educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them, and by God's grace do the very best for them, as our fellow-men for whom Christ also died.' Resolute, he sent for the War Department's cartographer…\nThe war with Spain gave rise to the only moment in US history when cartographers aggressively rejected the logo map. In its place they offered maps of the empire. Publishers, cashing in on empire fever, rushed to put out atlases showcasing the country's new dimensions…\nBy 1900, such maps were common. They appeared as a matter of course in atlases, on classroom walls, in textbooks and at the front of the census report. Some showed the North american mainland surrounded by insets. Others showed the United States stretching out over the world from the Caribbean to the edge of China. Either way, the message was clear: the country had undergone a metamorphosis.\nThis is clearly not hiding an empire - so what was? By the 1910s, once the glory of war had settled into the doldrums of occupation, the appeal of empire had vanished to the mainland audience - \"a regrettable drunken binge,\" in Immerwahr's telling. First Filipino and then Puerto Rican nationalists admirably profiled in the book, like Emilio Aguinaldo and Pedro Albizu Campos, agitated militarily for independence from rule by Washington DC.\nThe war in the Philippines was brutal, ugly stuff, reportedly claiming more lives than the American Civil War and defying the best efforts of the nascent Roosevelt administration to bring about a swift end. \"As [Aguinaldo] saw it, the point of guerrilla warfare was not to defeat the U.S. army…he hoped he might influence the 1900 presidential election.\" That year's Democratic party platform indeed called it a war of \"criminal aggression,\" thanks to the work of anti-imperialist activists no less prominent than Mark Twain.\nAs much of a push factor as the miseries of the Philippine War represented, anti-German sentiment which coalesced into a resurgence of white American nationalism pulled mainlanders away from any attachment greater than the purely imperial towards their colonies.\nWoodrow Wilson declared Flag Day in 1916, just two weeks before the first offensive in the Battle of the Somme, and as Immerwahr points out, even if they'd wanted to, there wasn't much for mainlanders in the old Stars and Stripes to celebrate about the empire:\nWhereas British children were made to examine the world map [for Empire Day], U.S. children venerated the national flag, which had a star for each state but no symbol for territories.\nIf U.S. teachers had pulled out their maps, as many surely did, it's not clear what they would have found on them. The 'Greater United States' maps in vogue a decade earlier were no doubt still hanging on some classroom walls, but by 1916 few such maps were being newly commissioned. Cartographers were returning to the old logo maps, showing only the states.\nBy this point, we've strayed from talk about cartography. The book does too, covering the exploits of the US in its colonies up to WW2 in the intervening period, but returns, just as Truman is unwinding the US' territorial claims, to discuss map projections, the favorite of every devoted West Wing fan.\nPivoting from Sorkin to Immerwahr, we find the following:\nIn 1898 imperial expansion had inspired new maps. The 1940s wartime expansion yielded a similar burst of cartographic innovation. Writers tapped surprisingly deep reservoirs of feeling as they touched on the subject of map projections. The long-familiar Mercator map, which showed North America protected on both sides by enormous oceans, became an object of scorn. It had worked well enough in an age of east-and-west sail, but the editors of Life deemed it 'a mental hazard' in an age of aviation…\nMore popular was the 'polar azimuthal projection' perfected by the dean of wartime cartography, Richard Edes Harrison. It showed the continents huddled around the North Pole, a jarring angle of view that highlighted aviation routes and showed how dangerously close North America was to Germany's European empire.\nThe map was an enormous hit, reprinted and copied frequently. Joseph Goebbels waved it in reporters' faces as proof of the United States' world-conquering ambitions. The U.S. Army ordered eighteen thousand copies, and the map became the basis for the United Nations logo, designed in 1945.\nWhile the history of cartography alone would make for a compelling read, there's a lot more to this. In fact, the breadth of topics which Immerwahr manages to fold into his book on American imperialism in itself is startling and worth reading, let alone the actual content of those topics. This is purposeful; as he claims, the work is designed to be \"perspectival, seeing a familiar history differently\".\nAs such, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma! comes out of the history of the actual settlement of Oklahoma, especially the former Indian territory never honored. The celebrated architect Daniel Burnham, designer of the White City and author of the Plan of Chicago, is revealed to have had much greater success in American-era Manila, though many of his creations were sadly destroyed in the Philippine Campaign of WW2.\nBurnham's Plan for Manila\nThe late 19th-C. craze for guano islands on the Pacific drove the earliest urges of American settlement beyond the North American continent, but the pioneering work of Fritz Haber, who synthesized ammonia, made the acquisition of guano moot. For this Immerwahr calls him \"arguably the single most consequential organism on the planet\".\nMore tragic is the story of Haber's later career; the worthy scientific work of his wife, Clara, stalled while her husband canoodled with Albert Einstein and set up a new institute for further research. After that work led to the development of poison gas, the German military staff kept Haber on tap to supervise its first deployment on French troops at Ypres. After that war, Haber helped develop a new insecticide named Zyklon A, and which would later be redeveloped into Zyklon B, used in the gas chambers of the Holocaust.\n\"Clara's relatives were among those who died in the camps,\" Immerwahr writes, continuing, \"Luckily, not all of them perished. Although Clara's married name was Haber, she is today known by her maiden name, the name under which she defended her dissertation: Clara Immerwahr. Her cousin Max was my great-grandfather.\"\nAfter that rhetorical mic drop, the book tracks the story of medical practice in Puerto Rico, in what turns out to be a particularly piquant example of the perspectival thesis. All $4.1 billion of the money managed today by the Rockefeller Foundation for \"improving lives and the planet\" would never have been put to work if not for an an early imperial-era deworming campaign on the island. Bailey Ashford, the physician responsible for this life-saving campaign, was replaced in time by one Dr. Cornelius Rhoads as the main medical administrator on the island. Rhoads, by contrast, spent much of his time performing detestable medical experiments on unconsenting patients; racist and eugenicist private correspondence of his, discovered by housekeepers, helped stoke the flames of revolutionary Puerto Rican nationalism.\nAnd yet while Ashford remained on Puerto Rico for love of the island, Rhoads went on to become director of Memorial Hospital in New York, then head of the medical division of the Army's Chemical Warfare Service, for which he received the Legion of Honor. He ended his career as the director of Sloan-Kettering, and the American Association for Cancer Research later established an award for promising young doctors in his name.\n\"But so complete,\" Immerwahr notes, \"was the informational segregation between Puerto Rico and the mainland that the prize was given for thirty-three years before anyone objected…Even the donor who'd funded the award hadn't known of Rhoads' Puerto Rican legacy. And that's how you hide an empire.\"\nI really can't say enough about this book; if you've followed along to this point just go out and read it.",

    title: "Local Zoning and Hukou - Systems of Mobility Management in the US and China",
    body: "The writer Michael Hobbes had an excellent thread on housing and homelessness the other day:\nThis is a good antidote to the zombie statistic that America has far more vacant homes than homeless people.\nThe raw figure might be true, but vacancies are concentrated in cities with declining populations. Homelessness is clustered in growing metros.https://t.co/ONqZajK1hI\n— Michael Hobbes (@RottenInDenmark) June 17, 2021\nAs Hobbes continues to say, “Every American city that sees a boom in incomes and employment also sees a spike in homelessness. Our deranged housing policy has made equitable urban growth a thing of the past.”\nThe relationship is indeed causal. The poster children for the current housing crisis in America are precisely those cities where high amenity construction and an influx of college-educated workers has not been followed by sufficient homebuilding ' San Francisco, Boston, New York and Austin; to a lesser extent Los Angeles and Seattle too. With no other alternatives, these new high-income workers bid up the existing housing stock ' this is the gentrification process ' and research by Zillow has found that future increases in homelessness is well-predicted by what comes next, i.e, increases in average rent. While the natural solution to an increase in the demand for housing in a place is to increase the supply for housing in that place, the issue has instead festered and spawned a kaleidoscope of groups all pushing their own solutions, each with a worse tradeoff than the last.\nIn a classic case of strange bedfellows, some NIMBYs and pro-homeless activists have pointed out that in fact there is no housing crisis, since the national housing stock is more than capable of housing the unhoused, with there being more vacant homes than homeless people. This is true, but subject to an obvious critique: since extra houses in Detroit can't be moved to Culver City, the only option remaining is to move some of the people out of the crowded cities into these extra homes. And while there are thoughtful approaches to this (like pursuing geographic redistribution as a tool of federal policy), more often than not proponents of this approach end up advocating for a deep and modern form of segregation.\nAs it happens, the mismatch of homes and jobs is not a uniquely American problem. China, amid its stomach churning rise to middle-income, has been groaning under the weight of a similar problem for decades. I want to compare the restrictions on mobility imposed by local control of zoning in the US with the top-down system used in China ' the hukou, which is a form of census and identification strategy that maps each Chinese citizen to a region and determines their eligibility for legal residence in other regions. Obviously, hukou is a rather more domineering way to control the movement of a population. But the effects of local control of zoning are no less severe; rather remarkably, the natural whims of homeowners in Marin County and the Upper West Side have come to align with the technocrats at the CCP.\n“Getting to Denmark”\nFirst some accounting: every population on Earth has become more urban since the Industrial Revolution, but the Americans (beginning in the 1850s) and the Chinese (beginning in the 1970s) were really good at it.\nIt was only by 1920 that the US would become a majority-urban nation; today about 80% of Americans live in cities. The late 20th C. suburbanization is evident to see in the below chart as a break in trend, as is the great return of the millennials to cities after 2008; to a first approximation, however, it's easy to see that urbanization followed a linear trend up for several decades before slowing at higher levels.\nThe Chinese have taken a much more volatile path to urbanization.\nIn 1949, the Communist Party took power in a country that counted 60 million urban residents, a mere spearhead compared to the 450 million living in the countryside.\nEarly on, they established the hukou, or “household registration” system, a tool of the command economy designed to help the party manage the vast Chinese population. Hukou were used to designate where residents would receive government benefits, like healthcare, schooling for their kids, and work eligibility. They came in two flavors, rural and urban, and while changes to hukou status were nominally allowed, in practice they were exceedingly rare: maybe something like 1% of all rural holders could have converted to urban status each year.\nChina Loosens Hukou Residency System to Spur Growth - Bloomberg\nThese are hukou ' they're physical books, sort of like IDs, with all the requisite data about each individual on them.\nHukou shaped Mao-era policymaking. As the Dear Leader's focus swung from rural collectivization to leap-frog industrialization and then back to iconoclastic civil struggle in the late 1960s, holding an urban hukou was tantamount to a stay of execution ' 19 in 20 deaths during the Great Chinese Famine were of rural hukou holders, as they were expected to feed themselves with the surplus remaining after CCP authorities had collected their grain targets, while urban residents received (meager, but reliable) state rations.\nEven after the death of Mao and up through the 80s, modern megalopoli like the Pearl River Delta were agricultural, still covered in “rice paddies and water buffalo,” as one urban studies scholar puts it. Shenzhen changed all that. Amid the raft of economic reforms which opened up special economic zones from 1979 onwards was a crack in the armor of hukou that allowed for rural merchants to legally bring their business to cities distinct from their own.\nFurther reforms in 1992 would open more benefits and a form of legal residency to migrant laborers in a few cities; yet more reforms in the early aughts would finally tear down the rural-urban distinction, replacing it instead with a “regional” hukou. Those reforms have basically worked:\nBy the mid-2000s, poor farmers in the Chongqing hinterlands had it well within their rights to cast down their plows and pick up factory tools ' but only in Chongqing. They couldn't leave behind the farm as easily for one of the dynamos like Shenzhen, Shanghai, or Beijing. And therein lay the rub.\nBetween countries, within countries\nWhile overall urbanization stats tell a simple story, they hide the changes in mix between cities which has attained a greater salience today. Put another way, like the UN does in 75-year report on Inequality, “Income inequality between countries has improved, yet income inequality within countries has become worse.”\nTaking the per capita personal income of the top 100 combined statistical areas in the US, we observe that the playing field has become much less equal. In 1969, the median CSA had personal income only 25% lower than the peak, in that year oddly enough represented by Reno, NV. In 2019, the median CSA had a personal income nearly 50% lower than the Bay Area's.\nThis development has important implications for individual behavior and the study of urbanization more broadly. If, say, rural productivity in 1969 was equal to an index of 25 on the chart, then even someone moving to the poorest CSA at that time ' New Orleans, LA ' could have expected to nearly triple their personal income.\nBy contrast, say rural productivity was again at 25 for 2019, then someone moving to the 100th-richest CSA, Lexington KY, would only expect to double their income. That 2019 mover has to get all the way to Minneapolis to triple their income like the person who moved to the Big Easy in 1969.\nPut simply, while the returns to urbanization were rather uniform in the mid-century, the distribution has skewed in our day. All urbanization is no longer created equal and the restrictions which prevent workers from moving to San Jose and Seattle and NYC and Boston are a club to the kneecap of broader American growth.\nTwo clever economists advanced this argument a few years ago and did the legwork too; they found that the increase in GDP from ending restrictive housing regulations and allowing greater mobility was astronomical ' from 1964-2009, the total increase in GDP would've been +36% higher than it was in reality, worth an extra $3.4tn in 09 dollars (Hsieh & Moretti, the authors of that study, corrected an error caught by the economist Bryan Caplan, which had actually underestimated the theorized effects by something like $2tn dollars!).\nBryan Caplan (in the form of Ray Allen) receiving the pass and sinking the trey from Hsieh & Moretti (in the avatar of Chris Bosh) regarding gains from densifying superstar cities.\nOf course, for all this to work you have to believe that the increase in income inequality between cities has actually come along with a decrease in mobility to those rich cities. But that does seem to be the case ' as above, we noted that these richest cities are ground zero for the housing crisis, places where housing costs are so high not only as to deter all the potential newcomers who don't have FAANG RSUs as part of their compensation, but also to actually evict present residents!\nThe real economists have weighed in on this for a while too ' the impacts of lower mobility are at the core of Tyler Cowen's Complacent Class. Davis & Haltiwanger (2014) found rates of job relocation fell by a quarter going into the 90s, while Molloy et al. (2011) declared internal migration to be at a 30-year low.\nMolloy et al. (2011), p. 174\nIf that's not enough for you, Brookings laid it out cleanly in a 2018 note called “Americans aren't moving to economic opportunity” ' more than half of migration out of “low vitality” counties was destined for other “low vitality” counties, and only 13% of migration from lowest vitality counties made it to highest vitality counties.\nThe Chinese economy has been no less susceptible to this phenomenon. The mid-aughts hukou reforms which got rid of the urban/rural split brought in new dividing lines, this time in the form of regional boundaries. This has caused its own chafing issues as poor rural residents want the gains from income possible in Shenzhen & Beijing and impossible in their local tier 3 urban area. Filmmakers like Jia Zhangke, who have made it out to the coastal superstar cities, pay testament to these inequities ' the lives of a group of miners in remote Shanxi province are depicted in A Touch of Sin as being all sound and fury, bitter cold and hard labor for meager wages.\nIt's no wonder that, as The Economist found in 2020, the smallest Chinese cities are actually seeing their hukou-compliant populations fall. Rural hukou holders have a certain “reservation” status, similar to job-seekers in a labor market, below which they will prefer to retain their rural status and forgo the social benefits of registration in the city in which they work. Xi Jinping, who wrote as a student about tinkering with hukou, has pushed a new initiative to spruce up these smaller towns and cities, with little word back on success.\nHukou today, as The Economist has it, is a game of three tiers: you'd love to but can't get into Shanghai and Beijing, you're ok with and can get into Chengdu and Xi'an, and you don't even want to get into small cities like Dawan or Wuwei.\nNIMBYism on the Pacific Rim\nNowadays the arguments for keeping strong hukou distinctions are weaker than ever. Faced with four years of Trumpian jousting, COVID-19, and a burgeoning demographic crisis, the party under Xi has been more and more active in tinkering with the rules and allowing for more migration, a strategy once referred to as adding a “new engine for the slowing economy”.\nWhere opponents of liberalization usually stake their claims is in arguments about the cost of providing for all those newcomers. In a very telling discussion, Fei-Ling Wang, a professor at Georgia Tech, describes the modern pressures on the reform camp:\nResistance to any proposed major reform now, ironically, comes from the urban people ' not ironically, but expectedly I guess ' and not necessarily from government planners. Government planners are hoping to speed up urbanization even in large cities so the economy can get a new driving force. However, urban officials, the local cadres, see this as compromising their current privilege. They see the rural folks as coming in to share their fruits. The urban-rural difference in China is horrendous ' living standard, income, education, medical service, you name it. This great gap really makes the urban folks feel they are privileged and wonder why they should share the scarce resources with country folk. The local officials also worry about it [hukou reform], as it may get local people really angry or create a management issue.\nFei-Ling Wang, quoted in The Diplomat\nThere we have it ' Chinese NIMBYism made flesh. What in the end distinguishes the ideas of those who were there first, either in China or the US, from those who would like only the chance to share in the fruits of high-productivity economies? Very little, except for a commitment to keeping the rest of us all a little poorer.",

    title: "Re: The NYT Piece on Extended Stay America and Modern SROs",
    body: "Mya Frazier has a blockbuster of a piece out in the NYT Magazine covering the people who live in long-term hotels, a group one of her sources refers to as the “precariously housed”. It's a very well-balanced read, taking the proprietor of one chain, Extended Stay America, to task for outsized room fees and brutish eviction practices while also lambasting high growth regions like Columbus and Atlanta for blocking the building of new housing. Taken as a whole, this piece (including the asides about revolting check-cashing fees) presents a crystal-clear accounting of the “high costs of being poor”.\nI wrote on Twitter that I see the key culprit here as being lack of new housing, which I am wont to do. The piece also highlights the decline in single-room occupancy hotels, which were once a robust part of the lowest-income housing market but were regulated away to death. But for her part, Frazier focuses more on the role of credit scores in denying many poor Americans access to the rental market.\nThe criticisms are all spot-on here, including a nice piece of grapeshot fired at the chancy figure of Richard Cordray, who in 2012 became the first boss of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after Elizabeth Warren decided to forgo leading the agency she'd molded and remain in the Senate. Cordray left the agency to go lose state-wide for the second time to Mike DeWine in the 2018 Ohio gubernatorial race but apparently landed on his feet in Biden's Dept of Education, running student loan claims.\nIn her piece, Frazier describes how the former director helped the credit-report triumvir of Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax pivot their businesses after the housing crash to peer deeper into the lives of poor people. They began to include “'alternative data,' such as rent and utility payments, into credit reporting…Cordray saw the push as good public policy — a form of 'financial empowerment.'”\nCredit reports have a shallow history - they were only used for the first time in 1989 - but as everyone knows, they control more than just prices for credit, the interest rate borrowers face; for people with bad credit scores, their score can lock them out of credit entirely or be used as a proxy rationale for institutions to enter into non-credit transactions with them.\nCase in point: the usage by landlords of credit scores for offering apartments. There is no prima facie reason why a landlord should be able to deny you an apartment in February because they worry about your payments in October - if October comes and you can't pay, you leave and it's on the landlord to find a new tenant.\nIt's kookier still to believe that that February rent should depend on credit mishaps from years prior. But that's how the industry has developed - landlords have been able to impose on renters everywhere the 12-month lease as a technology of brutal repression, making a simple payment for services into a loan-like contract.\n(One line of counterargument might emphasize that there are benefits to renters for this long-term contract, but I'm skeptical: when times are good, you can probably get a raise, so you could afford higher rent; but when times are bad, you lose everything, so you can't afford the prior level of rent anyway. Paradoxically, longer maturities benefit the creditor here.)\nThis point leads to two further and alternate observations. The first is that we should abolish credit scoring. This is seductive, but wrong-headed, because as the Frazier piece points out, credit scores were a technology that facilitated broader access to borrowing: “Credit scores…stratified credit markets. If you had a low score, you paid higher interest rates; once the process was automated, decisions that used to take days or weeks were made within hours.” That improvement in lending decision speed was useful, and shouldn't be thrown away.\nThe second observation is on sounder footing: if we must be stuck with a minority precariat, long-term leases, and predatory credit reporters, then credit scores must be reformed to move faster. If you get a new steady job, the weight of your prior credit should fall sharply. Entries in your credit history should stick around for a couple of years at most. Landlords should be steeply disincentivized against declining because of credit score, and instead should be biased towards green-lighting applicants unless something is incredibly wrong.\nSiegel Suites, the business operating the hotels where the piece is set, has carved a middle way through this dilemma by ignoring credit histories and offering short-term rentals. This is a good thing: for lack of Siegel, the women profiled in Frazier's piece would be flat-out homeless, as indeed her first subject was until she and her father learned about Siegel's offering.\nHowever, by being the only game in town willing to take on these higher risk renters, Siegel is able to charge exorbitant premiums above market rates. Of her second subject's budget, Frazier writes, “For about five months, Green and her partner managed to cover the initial daily room rate of $44.99, which would add up to more than $1,300 a month — almost twice the fair-market rent of $717 for an efficiency apartment in Columbus, as calculated by HUD.” Renters at Siegel Suites, started by a one-time NoHo body-shop owner, and the better-known Extended Stay America, deserve more competition in this space, which would drive down these painful premiums to rational levels. These landlords deserve some extra profit from the risks they're taking, but not very much.\n(As an aside, I've been curious about the model for the landlord decision to evict, prompted first by the closure of the Cinerama theater. When is it more advantageous to evict and reenter the tenant search market, rather than restructuring payments in arrears [even at 100% haircuts] and allow the current tenant to return to normal payment schedule? The fact that it took a CDC order to prevent evictions during the pandemic suggests landlords are quick to evict, a tendency too strong to be fully rational.)\nI criticized a recent story from a trio of NPR reporters which tried to account for the large racial homeownership gap by means of credit score discrimination, because I really don't believe that it's responsible for driving much of the variation in the purchasing process. But I am much more inclined to believe Frazier's account, that recourse to the three-digit number in rental markets has gone too far.\nAt the end of the day, you need a house over your head at whatever price you can afford, and it boggles the mind that the market for housing is insufficiently thick to provide that. More public investment is likely the answer.",

    title: "Local Notes No. 4 - Civic Architecture on Sunset Blvd",
    body: "I have been stymied for some months now in my attempts to visit Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. The massive structure, inspired by pre-Columbian art and architecture, sits atop a hill named Barnsdall Park in Los Feliz.\nIt was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019 and is an irreplaceable entry in Wright's Los Angeles oeuvre, whose other entries comprise probably the most interesting architectural body of work in the area. (The City has closed Barnsdall Park for COVID-19 reasons, but transmission of the virus is much reduced in our little slice of heaven, and at any rate it is an outdoor park, so I remain miffed.)\nLuckily, LA contains multitudes, and so by piloting yourself just a smidge further west, you can come across the two buildings I'd like to write about today: the headquarters of the International Cinematographers Guild and the Motion Picture Editors Guild.\nThe two buildings straddle Genesee Ave and are just about equal in size, filling up the corner quarter-acre on each block. They also do what they say on the tin, housing the offices of the union locals which represent the crews that make Tinseltown run. In today's age of atomized labor, the idea of a powerful, rich union making studio heads quake in their boots from showy modernist offices may read like science fiction. But the history of organized labor in film is long and rich - recall that Ronald Reagan, who ushered unions out of the modern workplace when he broke the Air Traffic Controllers' strike in 1981, first made a political name for himself as President of the Screen Actors' Guild. As the boss of SAG, Reagan led his actors on the first strike in film history and got the studios to cave to paying residuals.\nThe Gipper in 1947 presenting a SAG card to Lois Maxwell, who would later star as Moneypenny in several James Bond films.\nDavid Fincher's wonderful Mank sets itself right at the intersection of Hollywood and the drive for labor organization in the 1930s, though some of that action is backgrounded in favor of the drama of Upton Sinclair's abortive gubernatorial run. These days, tens of thousands of industry workers carry a union card, and their actions continue to shape film and TV history - as an example, Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad was set to be killed off by the end of the show's first season, but the notorious 2007-08 strike gave Vince Gilligan time to reconsider and rewrite the character for the long haul.\nhttps://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3CXmuv2l_NM?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\nThe Int'l Cinematographers Guild (ICG) and the Motion Picture Editors Guild (MPEG) are both locals under the umbrella of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, show business' most storied union, with origins dating back to Vaudeville theater. The ICG, housed in the westernmost of our two buildings, is Local 600 of the IATSE and represents anyone who touches a camera, including big-name DPs and cinematographers like Roger Deakins. The MPEG, meanwhile, is known as Local 700 of the same mother union, and represents both film and sound editors, as well as other editorial staff.\nThe battle to build these organizations was mighty, but well-rewarded in the years following the Great Depression. Membership rose as the guilds secured better wages from the studios, who were themselves navigating the new landscape being forged by the emergence of television. By the late 1950s, the ICG and MPEG were on sound enough footing to construct a new set of offices down the block from their first headquarters.\nThis plaza at Sunset and Las Palmas, funnily enough named the Crossroads of the World, was home to the MPEG starting in 1937.\nInternet records of the construction of these buildings are sadly scarce - if I were a more dedicated reporter, I would've gone into the Records desk at the city Dept of Building and Safety - but my sleuthing indicates that they were likely constructed as a pair beginning in 1959, under the design of the architectural partnership of Douglas Honnold and John Rex.\nMotion picture cameramen & film editors unions building, 7715 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, 1959 : News Photo\nStill of an architectural drawing of what was to become the MPEG headquarters.\nWriting on the work of Douglas Honnold often mentions that he passed up on an opportunity to design the McDonald's Golden Arches, which I find a bit unfair. Buildings he did actually design included the William Morris Agency building, several of a coffee chain known as Coffee Dan's, and the Valley Plaza Tower in North Hollywood, one of the first true skyscrapers in Los Angeles (a 150-foot city height limit was scrapped in 1957, and Honnold & Rex struck quick).\nHonnold was a skilled residential architect, too. He built an estate for Samuel Goldwyn, now owned by Taylor Swift, and participated in a contest run by the magazine Architectural Products to produce a set of “Research Houses”. This contest was in naked imitation of the famous “Case Study” effort launched by Arts & Architecture, many of whose designs became classics of the mid-century modern style. The Research Houses never ended up with such fame, but Honnold's entry has endured - Meryl Streep ended up owning the place before passing it on to Alex Rodriguez, who in 2019 sold it for a cool $4.4 million.\nHonnold & Rex together were part of an enduring clique of forward-thinking, hard-working architects who had their finger on the pulse of jetset-era Los Angeles, a city hurtled into the future we live in today via an influx of modernist thinkers and builders, eager for a postwar landscape they could leave their mark on. I admire their designs for the ICG and MPEG headquarters so much because they manage simultaneously to be pristine examples of the mid-century corporate style as well as to express their intended function with absolute clarity.\nIn the facade of the MPEG building, the interplay of the exposed steel beams and the glass-paned wall behind it creates a resemblance to a film reel, frames of office life perceivable through the shutters - an invocation of the very stuff the building's inhabitants spent their careers tenderly cutting and pasting together, or else leaving on the cutting-room floor.\nMeanwhile, in the ICG building's case, Honnold & Rex deftly carved mass atop mass to create apertures out of their walls, sculpted quadrangles conjuring an association to the camera's own eye. Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window had come out just five years prior, and its conceit resonates here - both the camera technicians indoors and we as passers-by outdoors cannot venture outside of the frame given us by the architects to view the world. To paraphrase Scorsese, the design of the ICG building is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out.",

    title: "Coming Late to McPherson's \"Battle Cry of Freedom\"",
    body: "The historian James McPherson released his survey of the Civil War era, Battle Cry of Freedom, in 1988. Despite its 900 pages of girth, the book was an overnight success and shared the 1989 Pulitzer Prize in History with Taylor Branch's equally mammoth Parting the Waters.\nNamed for the Civil War-era song that they used to sing I guess\nI came to it early in the pandemic when, faced with dwindling in-home activities, I nearly engineered a Kurswechsel into full Civil War buff. There's yet time for that, but more recently I turned again to the book and found some delightful tidbits.\nThe book opens, as it says, \"at midcentury,\" and McPherson takes you on an albatross' tour of the country's development. The famous Jacksonian market economy is detailed, as is the pace of western expansion. The narrative voice alights right around the time of the Mexican War, when a Pennsylvania Congressman named David Wilmot hurls a lit match into the political tinderbox that was arguments over statehood in the time of slavery.\nWilmot's Proviso was a BFD\nFrom there, it's all downhill - Lincoln's election is for McPherson the \"Revolution of 1860,\" secession and Fort Sumter the \"Counterrevolution of 1861\". Much emphasis is given to the reception of military outcomes in the home territories; dispatches from Birmingham or Atlanta or New York or Philadelphia newspapers give color to the political goings-on behind the front lines.\n1862, as McPherson details, was a banner year for the Union, especially in the Kentucky and Tennessee campaigns. From Cairo, the town memorialized in Huck Finn as the riparian entrance to the Old South, Army forces stabbed into the belly of the Confederacy.\nThere's not a lot of illustrations from Huck Finn, which strikes me as odd\nU.S. Grant made his name at Forts Henry and Donelson, redoubts along the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, where he along with Andrew Foote mounted a coordinated land-water invasion. A commander named John Floyd, who had previously brought scandal to his name by going out of his way to restock Southern armories as Buchanan's Secretary of War in full view of the coming crisis, was meant to be the Union's prize, but he escaped overnight. So too did a profiteering battalion commander named Nathan Bedford Forrest, who decided mere hours before Fort Donelson's surrender to slip out with his force across the icy Cumberland.\nCharacters abound in McPherson's telling, and they're all sketched in hokey, memorable ways. Charles Ellet, who built an impressive ramming squadron in the fresh-water Union navy through 1861 and 1862, was \"doughty\" and \"frail-looking,\" but died a glorious death in the Battle of Memphis. The \"most intrepid of all\" Union sailors, David Farragut, is \"angry as a hornet\" mid-battle. A Confederate war council at Fort Donelson was filled with \"the self-important Tennessee politician Gideon Pillow, and the darkly handsome, saturnine West Pointer Simon Bolivar Buckner\". Incredibly, Buckner's son, Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr., was the highest-ranking officer killed in World War II.\nThe battles ebb and flow across the long years, and some of the keenest observation McPherson brings is in charting the evolution of military strategy and tactics. The situation at Vicksburg was basically frozen by the summer of 1862 - the last stand of the Confederacy on the Mississippi, it would take the Union army over a year before Grant's daring campaign of maneuvers successfully took the city. Generals like Henry Halleck and George McClellan retarded the successful persecution of the war with old-timey beliefs - McPherson calls him \"Jominian,\" a reference to the noted war theorist Antoine-Henri Jomini, whose book on war crystallized the lessons of the Napoleonic Era. Part of Lincoln's great strategic wisdom was to know that these beliefs were outdated, and part of Grant's success was the way he threw the Jominian playbook out.\nOf course, perhaps the most notable change on the battlefield in the Civil War was the invention of ironclads, naval warships as we know them today which did not in fact exist before 1861. The CSS Virginia absolutely shredded the Union's old ships of the line in its debut engagement at Hampton Roads. Remarkably, the Union was able to launch its first ironclad, the USS Monitor, the next day, and the two fought to an historic standstill. When the Union army was able to capture the city of Hampton Roads not too much later, the greyshirts blew the Virginia up so as to avoid its capture; the Monitor was sunk in a storm not too much later.\nMore to come as I dip in and out of its old thing. A Civil War guy I may yet become.",

    title: "Local Notes No. 3 - The Brock & Co Jewelers Building in Downtown Los Angeles",
    body: "Happily, I got to go to Dodger Stadium yesterday to watch my Nationals lose the third of a three-game series and slink back east, well and truly swept. The loss didn't bug me too much though, as going to Dodger Stadium means going downtown and going to downtown Los Angeles means getting to see some really excellent architecture, still standing from a different era of Angeleno development.\nAnyone who's been by the famous Olvera Street is familiar with the fact that Los Angeles used to consist entirely of what we today call downtown. Land speculation in the areas surrounding the old pueblo during the 1880s brought a mass of migrants, swelling LA's population from its pre-American norm of ~10,000 people to 100,000 by 1896. In the twenty years that followed, the many-tentacled development of railways throughout the Southland would give the city more rail mileage than New York.\nAt the center of all that iron and all those people was the Historic Core of downtown, where booming economic fortunes spawned arcades of department stores, great canyons of banking houses, and a jewelers' district, where George C. Brock set up Brock & Co. jewelers in 1903. By the 1920s, Brock was doing so well in the diamond trade that he signed a 99-year-lease at 515 W 7th St, and there asked the architects Dodd and Richards to build him a new corporate headquarters.\n515 W 7th is a stunning building, even sitting squat as it does at only four stories tall. Indeed, its height sets it apart somewhat from its immediate neighbors - I find that its stature enhances the presentation of the whole thing, like a sprinter leaning forward to edge his opponents out at the finish line. Starting at bottom, the impression of iron frames and glass storefront is rather utilitarian, artfully set away from the shock yet to come above street-level. As we move up past the awning and into the mezzanine, with its lovely bronzed patina, we run for the first time into 515's complicated web of columns and windows, inset into its facade as a painting into a gilded frame.\nThe three stories of curvy pilaster breaking the glass space is striking, reminiscent of what others call the Churrigueresque style - others still refer to it merely as “Ultra Baroque”. The sinuous broken pediment which forms the top of the facade offers one last thrill for the eye, reveling in the full gaudiness of its curves.\nThe man responsible for the building's design was William J Dodd, an architect of Midwestern extraction who was trained in the offices of William LeBaron Jenney, builder of the first skyscraper. Dodd spent a remarkable quarter-century in Louisville, there and through other states back east building beautiful houses in the Beaux Arts style.\nIn 1912, he quit Kentucky for Los Angeles. In truth, no one may be more responsible for the way the south end of DTLA looks than Dodd - for the next twenty years he would have his fingers in most of the city's developing cookie jars. In 1917, he built an addition to the famous Brockman Building, then built Coulter's department store a block east.\nHis Henning Building went up right next to Coulter's, and the Huntsberger-Mennell Building popped up the same year on the 400 block. He finished his annus mirabilis on 7th St with the construction of the great Ville de Paris department store.\nDodd had a hand, early in his California period, in helping the great architect Julia Morgan to build William Randolph Hearst a new home for his Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Works like the Herald-Examiner Building show off some of the decorative flair Dodd would bring to the Brock building.\nThat decorative urge seems to have been everywhere in the SoCal air at this time - the revival of the Ultra Baroque in California is in fact credited to the architects responsible for the Panama-California Exposition of 1915, Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow. The pair chose a decidedly more Spanish style both to honor the history of San Diego, where the fair took place, as well as to stand apart from the Beaux Arts monuments so common of other fairs going on at the time. Think of Daniel Burnham's White City in Chicago, home of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, and you'll have a good feeling for what the organizers were rebelling against.\nThe Casa del Prado in Balboa Park, San Diego, erected for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. The Exposition helped revive the Baroque style in LA architecture.\nFunny enough, it was at that Panama-California Exposition where the modern history of San Diego was set out: Franklin Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, gave a press conference from Balboa Park where he described the new naval base set for construction in San Diego Bay. While their permanent structures were under construction, the Navy would use some features from the Exposition still standing, as would the San Diego Zoo, which cobbled together some poor leftover critters from the exotic corners of the fair to use for their first exhibits.\nFor all these reasons, Dodd was a natural architectural call for the jewelry shop to make. Headquarters in hand, Brock pere went on to make his little concern Los Angeles' biggest diamond dealer. Celebrities of a species we've all forgotten now, like Mary Pickford, frequented its 7th St halls.\nCoquette Poster\nPickford won 1930's Best Actress award for Coquette, advertised here as a '100% talking picture'. I bet it's a great movie!\nAd men combined Brock goods with great copy to make timeless ads like the one below. Per one source, Tiffany's actually approached Brock with the intention to merge their businesses, but the deal fell through.\nBrock & Co even had a minor place in California legal history, as they sought to have a 1937 tax assessment reduced, arguing that much of their valuable stock was not in Los Angeles but actually in Hawaii and therefore not subject to the duties set by the LA County Board of Supervisors. They lost at the California Supreme Court.\n1937 Ad Brock Jewelry Company Los Angeles Ring Diamond - ORIGINAL FTT9\n$535 for a diamond ring - good deal\nGeorge Brock retired in the 1960s and the Clifton family, who ran a network of popular cafeterias, bought the building out from him to install one of their franchises. Clifton's Silver Spoon Cafeteria operated until 1997 - Jack Kerouac mentions eating at one of their LA locations in On The Road.\nA diner carries a tray in Clifton's Silver Spoon. 1981 photo by Shelley Gazin, courtesy of the Gazin Archive.\nShot from a 1981 story about the Clifton Silver Spoon\nAfter that, the building briefly fell into disrepair, victim of the utter hollowing-out of DTLA in the years following the 1960s. History picked it back up as part of the vaunted Downtown LA revival in the late aughts, when a restauranteur refurbished its second floor and opened Seven Grand, a whiskey bar. Heads swiveled apace as young creatives poured into the watering hole, and a buzzy Mexican restaurant, Más Malo, followed the whiskey bar into operation a few years later. Network producers apparently liked the old styling of the Brock building's interior too - Scandal and Parks & Rec both have scenes filmed there.\nMás Malo met an abrupt end sometime in 2018, and the pandemic has meant that Seven Grand and Bar Jackalope, its speakeasy, have been shut for some time now. But I have faith that the life contained within William Dodd's otherworldly Spanish terra cotta and marble creation, dropped into the middle of what was once an old pueblo by the mid-century California king of diamonds, will rise again.",

    title: "Quests and Narrative Progression in \"Borderlands 3\" and Other Looter-Shooters",
    body: "Finished some longrunning content this week - took down Borderlands 3 and Luigi's Mansion 3. I have my gripes about both games, but will confine my remarks here to the former.\nBorderlands, as a series, is far more story-driven than I'd realized going in, a tendency which feels at odds with the gameplay structure. As I was streaming one of the missions late in the game, on the Eridian homeworld, the game urged me of a sudden back to Sanctuary to hear the Greek chorus of NPCs blather on before sending me back to Pandora, for the game's final mission. Stiff models of the main characters, which I as a (quasi-)series newbie had neither familiarity with nor great affection for, delivered lines about the galactic goings-on just ahead of us, fully on display, while my avatar (hollow as that word is), Amara, stood, her weapon held up in front of her, obstructing my view.\nThis description is given to point out an instance of what I believe to be a ludonarrative dissonance emergent in the structure of Borderlands 3, which others among its genre - what I'll generally call looter-shooters, though varying amounts of looting and shooting obtain among them - sidestep, tacitly or otherwise. In Destiny or in Diablo, quest-givers and story-critical characters are rather quicker in saying what they need to and getting out of the player-character's way. This decision privileges the continuation of the all-important gameplay loop: the deployment of new skills and weapons on the world-objects, the flash of ever more spectacular particle effects on-screen, the recoupment of yet newer skills and abilities, and lastly the shift in environmental location, that the loop might recur with a new skin grafted atop it. This loop has long been held as the defining feature of the looter-shooter (in other parlance some writers speak of Skinner box game design).\nIf embedded in that loop of a gameplay structure we recognize two principal skeins, by which I mean the components the developers create and manipulate to achieve their artistic goals, we can best identify those as the mechanical skein and the setting skein. Skeins themselves are comprised of formal elements, like story, narrative, characterization, gamefeel, progression, empowerment, environment (in all its forms), etc., but all formal elements belong to one skein or the other, and not to both.\nIn that language, we can see that the approach taken by Destiny and Diablo is to jettison story as a formal element of setting and install mechanical player-character progression as the primary formal element within the gameplay structure.\nWe know moreover that there is magic in the overlapping interaction of the two skeins, and it may in fact be the case that looter-shooters, constitutionally, fail to apprehend any of that magic. For the loop, which drives progression, is massively sensitive to interruption - this is why a common lament of looter-shooters involves menu design and inventory management, for these are necessary parts of the game which are also necessarily outside of the loop (this is moreover why the console port of Diablo 3 received such high plaudits - it solved, or came close enough anyway to solving, a previously intractable problem).\nDecades of advance in game development have yielded little fruit in another area which has tended to exist outside of the loop - the tools of story presentation have long been stagnant, and each implementation today is little more than a variation on another. Schematically, the structure of looter-shooter stories goes as follows: To advance the story, players undertake quests comprised of objectives, upon whose conclusion players must return to quest-givers and receive quest updates, a step without which progression - and the loop - cannot be restarted, as exploration is halted. These quest-givers then deliver the story update via speech, either in monologue or dialogue, whose result is the assignment of new quest-objectives.\nPrecisely here is where the rub lies. Quest updates in Borderlands 3 are given by actors behind a proscenium arch, an effect created by both the persistent 1st-person perspective and the silence of the player character. These updates have a very wooden feel - within the arena-environment, the part of the game world where the mechanics are acted out, technological limits severely constrain the possibilities for artful character blocking, interaction, or drama. Borderlands, as a series, has always sought to alleviate this uncanniness and forestall player disengagement with witty writing, as a radio program or talk show might. These efforts, it should be said, are often successful, especially when paired with dense, creative environmental design; but it is also the case that not all attempts of this breed can be successful, and more likely that at least a plurality of attempts will fail to rouse a laugh in the player, precisely because so much of the wit relies on timing, and updates are entered into with no precise rhythm, only on the whim of the player-character.\nAs some of the wit must fall flat, there is now a guarantee baked into the game design that the player will be bored during updates and that as a consequence, the loop will be interrupted and progression will suffer. Borderlands is and has been a successful game not because of the interaction between its two skeins but rather in spite of it, as the highs of the mechanical experience are sufficiently lofty to compensate for the doldrums of the story-setting.\nWhat's most peculiar about this outcome is that the tools chosen for story delivery in Borderlands are easily seen to be, a priori, the least intrusive means of interrupting the gameplay loop. In particular, the persistent en vivo perspective within the arena-environment requires no shift in player identification or user interface to complete the necessary agenda of the story update. The player-character may still take advantage of all the facets of mechanics available to them - the verbs of running, jumping, shooting, weapon switching, crouching, ability casting - even if that advantage earns less profit, owing to the local geography in which the story update takes place usually being denuded of arena-objects (take this term to mean, basically, enemies or interactable environmental components).\nA player might even, according to their tastes, turn away from the quest-giver mid-update and walk away, or go and begin another quest-update. What again emerges as a problem is the precise timing of the quest-update: although player freedom within the arena-environment persists during the quest-update, that freedom is, all of a sudden, shockingly undirected. The player must wait for the end of the quest-update, when objectives are refreshed, quests are given anew, and the game world is ready to acknowledge the next player action.\nWere the quest update handled slightly differently, such that the world-readiness was triggered merely at the outset of the quest update; or were it the case that quest updates involved the cashing-in of many chained objectives and the projection of many long-ranging objectives-to-be-done, this problem would be so scarcely felt that it may never have risen to attention at all. While those analog tweaks are unobservable from where we sit today we may by comparison with alternative implementations of the quest update system derive some further understanding as to the optimal arrangement of things in this our genre.\nWe take as our objects of analysis the other aforementioned looter-shooters, namely Destiny and Diablo, and will assess the necessary interruptions in their loops in turn. The Diablo quest system is aided by relatively larger environments in which the first part of progress is always exploration - note the expanding of the lit areas of the map, the expulsion of the fog of war which has been so long a mainstay of that game's play. This means that individual objectives may be sustained over many loop cycles, with returns to quest-givers only needed after a long period. This, as conjectured above, would probably serve to ameliorate the thorny annoyance of the radio program model we took a look at in Borderlands, had that been the model taken up by Diablo's creators.\nIt was, however, not, and instead they implemented a design for quest updates which I analogize to the reading of a book. What's notable about Diablo is that despite its position as the genre-progenitor - recall the first entry appeared in 1997 - relatively little about its design has changed to today. Tool invention, the basis of the implementation of formal elements, then was tightly bound by the technological frontier - the fog of war effect alleviated the burdens placed on already taxed GPUs, while text-box based character interaction was merely paradigmatic. They stumbled, happily, on a winning formula amid those strictures, and have needed not to change it since.\nIndeed by Diablo's reckoning, the proper relationship of story to setting (and, transitorily, of the story to the mechanics) is akin to an iceberg. A certain sum floats above the water and must obligatorily impressed upon the player. Otherwise, the game runs the risk of substituting for the long-term purposive fuel of narrative the chained short-term highs of the mechanical loop (this is a problem not unfamiliar to bank executives and financial regulators). This obligatory story content, however, need not come exclusively through the quest-giver's diegetic speech-updates, and keen developers will be quick to realize this.\nTo that end, then, Diablo puts the whole of the story in its quest updates, but also lets the player set his own pace in dismissing the update and continuing with the loop. A critical tool here is the way the quest update alters the player perspective: it pulls focus, halting the verb-expression of the player and opening a new, segregated mode of the game world. Instead of allowing the natural rhythm of the loop to die its own death while the quest-giver delivers an update, the use of the segregated mode severs the player's connection to the loop and to the arena-environment in which it takes place. One can dismiss the segregated mode nearly as quickly as it appears and rejoin the arena-environment; but in this way, and through thoughtful, punchy writing, Diablo can shake the player loose of his mechanical loop-delirium, deliver the modicum of story needed, and spit the player out once more to fulfill the story's next objectives.\nTo its credit, Destiny, too, makes use of the segregated mode, albeit with changes sufficiently large to obtain different effects upon the play-experience. Destiny's implementation I analogize to a ticket-counter at an arcade. Bungie, the series' developer, has chosen to elevate the quest-giver from being merely a tool of story into a hybrid form, setting into motion the formal elements of both the mechanical and setting skeins. By this I refer to the cashing-in of both quest-objectives and incidental bounties, where loot generation - critical within the loop mechanism - is handled also in large part by the quest-giver. The length of time needed for this cashing-in is non-negligible, an important component of the feedback system which makes Destiny such a tactile experience.\nTo account for this, the quest updates are not text-skippable as in the book model but instead closer to Borderlands' voiced-diegetic implementation. The saving grace, then, comes in the freedom of the player to exit the segregated mode, halt the speech of the quest-giver, and continue on anyway with the new quest's objectives.\nWhat this choice brings about is a relocation of the story-delivery from the stationary, active quest-giver to a moving, passive accrual within the arena-environment in the course of the quest. This is the motivation behind the Ghost character as well - in a system where more story is to be delivered on foot (as it were), the presence of a character capable of providing story everywhere the player goes is needed. Think instead of how much sillier the presentation might seem with quest-givers and other NPCs not actually present with the player reacting to the movements and deeds of the player, environment, and arena-objects.\nBecause the quest-givers' role is more as mechanical figure than story-deliverer, the focus pull upon player interaction does not, as in Diablo, succeed in impressing upon the player the critical story. It is then the case that the “distant delivery” is the only way players obtain narrative justification for their actions. Because these distant deliveries take place as the player is navigating the arena-environment, the guarantee of any one component of story being impressed upon the player is never achieved. This is an uncanny balance, which does not resolve neatly, and may provide for the player an incomplete experience.\nI hold the quest-update as the most interesting and critical locus of looter-shooters as a genre, as it's only here that the long-proven model of the loop is forced to stop. How a developer chooses to implement narrative progress amid the player-driven mechanical progress is key towards putting together a consistent, engaging experience. Diablo, in its earliest incarnation, may have hit precisely upon that magic I described earlier as occurring in the intersection of the two skeins of formal tools, the mechanical and the setting, as can frequently happen when the right idea, the best people, and just enough technological limitations come together. Destiny forgoes really nailing the quest update system in favor of a loftier environmental experience, and I think this focus serves the game well. Verticality, which Destiny knows how to do, is often the mot juste for transcending the mechanical-setting divide. And there's something transcendent as well about the dogged fervor of Borderlands' loop, the ribald creativity and range of the mechanical experience, the vivid characterization of player and arena-objects, bordering on caricaturization. The radio show, the book, the ticket counter - all three in their own way avenues to stand athwart the looping player and yell, “Stop!\"",
