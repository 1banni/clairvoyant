# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep


# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
/config/master.key


# Ignore API keys
/frontend/env.development.local
.env


# ignore files in public directory (b/c you want Render to generate them)
/public


# Ignore local storage
/storage/*
!/storage/.keep
# A '!' in a .gitignore file serves to negate the pattern, i.e., it signifies
# that the following pattern should be included. It is used when a previously
# specified pattern would call for a necessary file to be ignored. So these
# two lines together say to ignore everything (*) in the top-level (/)
# storage/ directory except (!) .keep. A .keep file serves simply to keep the
# directory from being empty so that git will include it
